                "body": "End Game Luka Doncic will become the first of many special cards NBA 2K23 players will get to enjoy in Season 8. Developers 2K Sports gave the information on June 29 on the game's official Twitter account. Superstars from the older and current era in the form of Dark Matter, Invincible, and End Game items will join the Mavs superstar.\n\nSeason 8 is set to go live on June 30, and 2K Sports has already briefed the community about what they can expect. Plenty is in store for MyCareer and MyTeam fans, including a free End Game Steph Curry card on the first day of the season. With Doncic and others coming into the fray of things, there's plenty of reason for NBA 2K23 players to grind out the new season.\n\nLuka Doncic has quickly risen into superstar territory following his move to the NBA. NBA 2K23 players can enjoy his End Game card if they are lucky enough to pack him at first. However, there are certainly other names that are worth a deeper look at during Season 8.\n\nThree cards are being introduced to packs as part of the new season.\n\nFour more NBA superstars will receive Invincible cards in Season 8, which expands the existing list even further.\n\nFinally, the three new End Game cards are led by Luka Doncic's PG/SG item. The two other options in NBA 2K23 are the following:\n\nThese cards will be available in packs for a limited time once the new season begins. There is no guarantee that players will receive one, but there is a good possibility they will. These packs will be available for MT coins or VCs, and the cards can also be found in the My Auction section. The more popular names will certainly be expensive for the next few days.",

                "body": "Chase Claypool thinks the Chicago Bears are set for a very promising future, but his detractors say otherwise.\n\nThe wide receiver recently told talkSPORT that he believes last year's NFC North cellar-dwellers have \"an exciting and dynamic team.\" He added:\n\n\"We are going to be a fun team to watch and we are not going to back down from anyone.\"\n\nAnd while the Bears do have young and interesting pieces, not everyone agrees:\n\n\"Well he'll blow up plays for sure\"\n\n\"Hang on, does Claypool know enough about the offense to be able to call it explosive?\"\n\n\"'We probably won't be that fun to watch, and we most likely will fold when facing adversity'\"\n\n\"Yawn\"\n\n\"Claypool judges \"explosiveness\" based on how many deep balls he drops\"\n\n\"Yeah..this is june. Talk to us in september claypool.\"\n\nThe Bears are in the midst of one of the longest championship droughts in North American sports, having last won a Super Bowl in 1985-86. They lost Super Bowl XLI to Peyton Manning's Indianapolis Colts and have not made it back to the NFC Championship Game since 2010-11.\n\nCurrently mired in a two-season playoff absence, the Bears executed one of the best trades this year, when they traded the No. 1 pick, which turned out to be Bryce Young, to the Carolina Panthers for wide receiver DJ Moore, who joins Claypool, Darnell Mooney, and tight ends Cole Kmet and Robert Tonyan in a burgeoning aerial corps. That move confirmed their trust in quarterback Justin Fields, who helped the team lead the league in rushing yards.\n\nAnd Fields is not the only rusher teams should watch out for. D'Onta Foreman has joined Khalil Herbert in creating a two-headed running back tandem, replacing David Montgomery, who has left for the divisional rival Detroit Lions. Their ground exploits should be easier now with the drafting of tackle Darnell Wright, who is expected to complement Braxton Jones.\n\nThe Bears' defense has also received an upgrade in the form of linebackers Tremaine Edmunds and TJ Edwards, each coming off playoff appearances. The two are expected to be complemented by a defensive backfield led by two-time Pro Bowler Eddie Jackson.",

She accessorized with a black handkerchief scarf and a wide-brimmed hat.\n\n\"Vera's Saloon,\" the caption reads.\n\nWang's \"eternal beauty\" garnered praise from fans asking her to point them in the direction of \"the fountain of youth.\"\n\n\"She looks half her age -- it's actually nuts! Ma'am please point us to the fountain of youth,\" a fan wrote, while another chimed in, \"OK, I can't believe this woman is 74 years old and look this damn good.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Wang has been praised for her age-defying looks. Back in 2020, she shared photos of herself modelling her own designs for David's Bridal, leaving fans once again stunned by her youthful appearance and toned figure.\n\n\"You would be really shocked,\" she told Elle, adding, \"I didn't expect the reaction to be so huge. I just thought we were just selling some barrettes!\"\n\nThe designer admitted that the photoshoot was an impromptu decision while she was at home during COVID.\n\n\"I live alone, obviously,\" she explained. \"And so those photos were taken during quarantine as kind of a laugh, but also a real refusal to give up.\"\n\n\"I had a collection to promote with no models, no photographer, no hair, no makeup. But I was in Miami, and you know, you cannot beat Miami sunlight at 5 p.m. It is goddamn gold, you know what I mean? You could be Jack the Ripper in front of it and he would look good,\" she added.\n\nSo I said, \"Look, we've got these barrettes we want to show. Let me just put them on Instagram.' I threw on a [Palm Angels] sports bra because it was too hot for anything else -- it was like, 95 degrees!\"",

                "title": "Letters to the Editor: Abrupt end to hurling season for some teams",
                "body": "The standard of the Munster championship has been such as to verify that all is well, indeed very well, in our hurling world. Unfortunately, this is neither true at the 'Liam McCarthy' level nor at the 'Joe McDonagh' level.\n\nWhatever about fixing the deep-seated 'ills' and imbalance of a continuously less than competitive Leinster championship, the Joe McDonagh Cup can be greatly improved by affording it real appreciation and by giving it much more respect.\n\nThe 'Joe McDonagh' is being run off with indecent haste and earlier than necessary, all so that the finalists can be fed into the 'resuscitation programme' of the third placed teams in both the Munster and Leinster championships.\n\nCarlow and Offaly campaigned magnificently in this season's Joe McDonagh Cup, ultimately playing out a high quality, closely fought final. However, they soon became lambs to the slaughter as their seasons came to an abrupt end against the 'rekindling' Liam McCarthy teams.\n\nConsequently both Carlow and Offaly now await the 2024 season with a 10-point and a 42- point defeat, respectively, in the rear view mirrors of this season. Finalists in previous seasons fared little better.\n\nGiven due respect, counties such as these should only now be coming to the end of their 'championship' in the deserving context of opening games in the concluding stages of the 'Liam McCarthy'. Then, having won or lost, be allowed to appreciate and reflect on reaching their pinnacle without having to ready for certain hurling demolition within days.\n\nI am eight years old and I play camogie and ladies' football with St Finbarr's. I love both sports, and hope to keep playing for many years.\n\nI believe it is terribly unfair that, because of scheduling, the senior players in both sports have to choose which to play this Saturday.\n\nAs a fan I too have to choose which game to go to, to cheer on my heroes, which is unfair.\n\nI hope the people organising the matches in the LGFA and the Camogie Association don't do this again.\n\nOn Thursday, June 22, we had to go to Cork Airport to collect our daughter's car as her flight had to be diverted to Dublin.\n\nA minor inconvenience but it afforded us the opportunity to meet an extraordinarily helpful member of the airport police. Seán O'Farrell went to exceptional lengths to help us when we discovered our key would not work.\n\nHe is a credit to the force he represents, the uniform he wears and the proud Doheny people in his native Dunmanway. Thank you Seán.\n\nI've asked the following question of RTÉ news many times. Why is it, when alcohol is mentioned in a news report, we are shown endless shelves of easily identifiable alcohol bottles and taps as visual material? Why not imagery of the devastation alcohol actually causes? With its involvement\n\nin about 80% of public order offences, how is this allowed? Why, at a time when everything is up for review, does this need special investigation?\n\nWith disappointment, I heard of the decision to cancel part of this year's summer season of performances by Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre of Ireland.\n\nI performed for over a decade with the company and my experiences in the summer season were formative in my development as an artist and remain important to my ongoing research. Previously living in Cork and now resident in Louth, I am always surprised at the number of people I meet who travelled to Kerry to see performances by the Siamsa Tíre from the 1970s to more recent times.\n\nAlthough the company have indicated that the venue remains open, this suggests a limited understanding of what Siamsa Tíre is, what they have achieved and what the summer season stands for.\n\nAs a community company, Siamsa Tíre have pioneered folk theatre in Ireland, entertained audiences for over five decades and performed internationally.\n\nThe Siamsa Tíre Summer Season is a flagship. It attracts members to the Siamsa Tíre Academy, which the statement from the company confirms will remain open and recently held auditions for new members.\n\nWithout a summer season to aspire to as I did, I wonder what goals they will aim for and if I will be hearing about it in Louth or elsewhere in the future.\n\nThe 'holier-than-thou' attitude of those isolationists who pretend that Ireland can and should stay 'neutral' is out of line with the challenges of today's world. Ireland as it stands is the broken link in Europe's defence line against bad actors whether it is drug smugglers, human traffickers or rogue nations.\n\nWe have for the last 50 years been glad to take money from our European neighbours, ie, the EU, but this cannot be a one way street. The Irish nation has a moral obligation to return this support by committing to a stronger Europe and as part of this obligation, a stronger European defence system.\n\nMuch of our nation's future wealth will come from the seas which surround us, but we will have to be able to defend those seas and the infrastructures which will be located there and this will be best served in cooperation with our EU friends and neighbours.\n\nTerry Prones' forensic analysis of the protagonists' ill-conceived responses to the RTÉ debacle makes scrumptious reading -- 'RTÉ's statement fails to nail down who came up with the method of deception' (Irish Examiner, online, June 28). This is not me gloating at someone's possible downfall ... just appreciation of Terry Prone's insightful summation.\n\nI watched in sheer horror as the Oireachtas media committee interrogated members of the RTÉ board. The adversarial attitude of virtually all of the politicians will ensure a dearth of people who might be willing to attend and inform us of matters pertaining to the public interest in future.\n\nSomebody should tell them -- the committee members -- to tone it down. It scares me to think what they might do were they given even more power.\n\nOf course the board should know its business. But bear in mind some board members receive in or around €15,000 annually for their trouble. This week's haranguing is never worth it.\n\nDee Forbes was brought in to make changes -- on a budget. Clearly she did what she could, took risks she shouldn't have and is hardly anywhere near 100% to blame. But she has gone. It will all blow over, and with no disrespect to the hundreds of less fortunate employees, is it not better to focus on RTÉ getting its act together and saving as much face and credibility as possible in the interests of all?\n\nArmed with the knowledge now available, employees and their unions should be able to protect all employees interests in future.\n\nThere should be a cap on fees/salaries of €100K per annum for RTÉ's entire workforce including the broadcaster's 'top talent'. These top earners should be employed directly by RTÉ and not be on contracts negotiated by agents.\n\nMost RTÉ employees -- journalists, researchers, technicians, etc, can never hope to earn such vast amounts of money and many are employed on precarious contracts including 'bogus self-employment' contracts. These workers, as with the general public have been betrayed by their employers, the RTÉ board and the RTÉ executive.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, this crisis should not be used as an excuse to further delay reform of RTÉ's funding and further undermine public service broadcasting.\n\nThe licence fee should be abolished and instead RTÉ should be funded directly by means of progressive taxation.",

                "body": "Sri Lanka won all their games in the group stage of the 2023 ICC World Cup Qualifier in a resounding fashion, which pits them as one of the favourites for the competition. They start their Group Six campaign against the Netherlands and will be hoping to build on their winning run. In an ideal scenario, Sri Lanka should not have been playing the qualifiers, having been the runners-up in 2007 and 2011. But years of underperformance and lack of consistency in team selection meant the team continued to spiral down the rankings and ended up playing these games. Opponents finished second in their group and the team has pulled off some major upsets in the recent past, which should keep Sri Lanka on their toes. Sri Lanka versus the Netherlands will be telecasted on the Star Sports network and streamed on Disney+ Hotstar from 12:30 pm IST. Sean Williams Scores His Third Century of ICC World Cup 2023 Qualifier, Achieves Feat During Zimbabwe vs Oman in Super Six Clash.\n\nKusal Mendis is the key man in the middle-order for Sri Lanka and he will have to hold up one end for the Sri Lankans. Pathum Nissanka and Dimuth Karunaratne will look to attack from the onset and make the powerplay count. Dasun Shanaka has done well in the T20 format but is also an integral member of the team in the fifty-over format.\n\nThe Netherlands was involved in one of the greatest games of cricket in their win over the West Indies. Teja Nidamanuru scored a brilliant century to announce his arrival on the big stage and launched a brilliant partnership with skipper Scott Edwards against the West Indies. The duo, along with Vikramjit Singh, will once again be the player to watch out for. Their bowling is ordinary, which is a cause of concern for the team management.

So, the Sri Lanka vs Netherlands Super Six match of the CWC 2023 Qualifier will be telecast live on Star Sports 1/HD channels in India.\n\nSri Lanka vs Netherlands Live Streaming Online, ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 Qualifier\n\nAs Star Sports holds the broadcast rights, its OTT Disney+ Hotstar will provide live streaming online of ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. So, fans can tune into the Hotstar app or website to watch the SL vs NED live streaming online. FanCode will also provide live streaming online of the SL vs NED ODI match on its app and website. Fans will have to pay a subscription fee to watch live streaming on both platforms. Sri Lanka will dominate the contest and should secure an easy win here.",

                "body": "Nouvelle étape dans la guerre entre la ministre des Sports et l'ex-patron du foot français : la Cour de justice de la République (CJR) enquête sur Amélie Oudéa-Castera.\n\nUne information judiciaire est ouverte depuis le 21 juin à la CJR, seule juridiction habilitée à juger des ministres dans l'exercice de leur fonction, après des propos de la ministre en février sur la gestion au long cours par M. Le Graët de la Fédération française de football (FFF), a appris l'AFP vendredi de source judiciaire.\n\nNoël Le Graët a démissionné en février avec fracas de la FFF, qu'il dirigeait depuis 2011, après un rapport d'audit accablant de l'Inspection générale de l'éducation, du sport et de la recherche (IGESR) sur sa gestion, sur fond d'accusations de harcèlement sexuel.\n\nÀ lire aussiAmélie Oudéa-Castéra, la ministre qui fait trembler le sport français\n\nLes inspecteurs de l'IGESR estimaient dans ce rapport que Le Graët \"ne dispos(ait) plus de la légitimité nécessaire pour administrer et représenter le football français\", compte tenu notamment de son \"comportement inapproprié (...) vis-à-vis des femmes\".\n\nQuelques heures après son départ, son avocat avait annoncé une plainte, affirmant que Mme Oudéa-Castera avait \"menti\" sur ce rapport et pointant du doigt une différence entre la synthèse du document, publiée le 15 février et qui évoquait l'envoi par M. Le Graët de \"SMS ambigus pour certains et à caractère clairement sexuel pour d'autres\", et son intégralité.\n\nSelon un extrait, consulté à l'époque par l'AFP, la mission d'inspection avait constaté \"un faible nombre d'écrits (SMS notamment) produits par M. Le Graët, utilisant des formulations ambiguës pouvant recevoir différentes interprétations et un vocabulaire ne comportant aucun terme à caractère sexuel\".\n\nLa procédure en matière de droit de la presse rend quasiment automatique, après une plainte en diffamation, la saisine d'un juge d'instruction et la mise en examen de l'auteur des propos, le débat de fond se déroulant à l'audience.\n\nÀ lire aussiPlainte de Le Graët contre Oudéa-Castéra : \"Je ne l'ai jamais accusé de harcèlement, c'est affligeant\", rétorque la ministre des Sports\n\nLa jurisprudence est toutefois différente devant la CJR. En 2014, sa commission des requêtes avait ainsi classé une plainte en diffamation du polémiste controversé Dieudonné contre Manuel Valls, alors ministre de l'Intérieur, estimant d'emblée que le délit de diffamation n'était pas suffisamment caractérisé.\n\nEn 2010, la même commission des requêtes avait aussi classé sans suite une plainte en diffamation du Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l'amitié entre les peuples contre Nadine Morano, alors ministre.\n\nM. Le Graët fait l'objet d'une enquête préliminaire pour harcèlement moral et sexuel ouverte par le parquet de Paris. L'ex-directrice générale de la FFF Florence Hardouin, entendue en avril dans cette enquête, a porté plainte contre lui.",

Indian women's hockey team captain Savita is confident in her team's preparation and ability to finish on top of the podium at the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games, which will take place in September and October of this year.\n\nNew Delhi [India], June 30 (ANI): Indian women's hockey team captain Savita is confident in her team's preparation and ability to finish on top of the podium at the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games, which will take place in September and October of this year.\n\nIn the latest episode of Hockey Te Charcha, a podcast series launched by Hockey India, Commonwealth Games (CWG) medallist and star goalkeeper Savita, who recently won the prestigious Hockey India Balbir Singh Senior Award for Player of the Year (Women) shared her thoughts on the team's progress, her journey as the team captain and equal recognition for women's hockey.\n\nAlso Read | England vs Australia 2nd Test 2023 Day 3 Live Streaming Online: Get Free Live Telecast of ENG vs AUS Ashes Cricket Match on Sony Sports With Time in IST.\n\nTalking about the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games, Savita said, \"In the last Asian Games, we came close to winning the Gold medal; and losing only by a goal to Japan (1-2) in the Final was heart-breaking. This time we feel that we are more determined than ever before to finish on the top.\"\n\n\"Every player in the team knows that we have to win the Gold to earn direct qualification for the Paris Olympics. This is the best scenario for us so that post-Asian Games, we can shift focus on the FIH Pro League and then Paris 2024,\" she added.\n\nAlso Read | Ashes 2023: Australia Provide Update On Nathan Lyon's Injury, England 278/4 At Stumps On Day 2 of 2nd Test.\n\nHaving taken over the Captaincy post Tokyo Olympics, Savita emphasised that she is enjoying the dual role of goalkeeping and leadership. \"There is an extra responsibility when you are leading the team. Even when I was not the Captain, I knew that I had to share the leadership duties and help the team as a goalkeeper. As a senior member on the side, it was my responsibility to help young and less-experienced teammates by sharing my experience with them,\" she said.\n\nShe also highlighted the team's collaborative spirit, saying, \"It's not just the Captain or Vice-Captain who has the responsibility. Even the younger players are ready to take on responsibility, thanks to our Coach Janneke Schopman for instilling these qualities in the team. I believe that everyone should be able to make their own decisions on the pitch without involving anyone.\"\n\nThe podcast also touched upon the growth and recognition of women's hockey in India in the last decade. Savita expressed her pride, saying, \"If I compare today's situation to what it was in 2008 when I joined the team, there's a massive change and the respect for women's hockey in the country has grown multifold. Whether it's about facilities, exposure or recognition, women's hockey is getting its due.\"\n\n\"Even the Hockey India Annual Awards serves as a great motivation for us. When the awards began, honestly, I didn't even know that a women's team goalkeeper could be picked over the men's team goalie for the award. So, I was like, I want to be up there, like PR Sreejesh someday, receiving the award.\"\n\nSavita also shared her joy in witnessing the financial independence of her teammates due to hockey, stating, \"When I started playing hockey, the situation was not that great and I had to wait for nine years to get a job. There were some players who were not even sure of getting two square meals a day. But now, the players are able to build houses for their families. They have regular jobs. And even the youngest member of the team is doing well financially and this shows that the sport is actually moving in the right direction.\"(ANI)\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

Even when I was not the captain, I knew that I had to share the leadership duties and help the team as a goalkeeper,\" said Savita, who recently won the prestigious Hockey India Balbir Singh Senior Award for Player of the Year (Women).\n\n\"As a senior member on the side, it was my responsibility to help young and less-experienced teammates by sharing my experience with them.\"\n\nThe star goalkeeper said Indian women's hockey has grown by leaps and bounds, offering financial independence to the players.\n\n\"If I compare today's situation to what it was in 2008 when I joined the team, there's a massive change and the respect for women's hockey in the country has grown multifold. Whether it's about facilities, exposure or recognition, women's hockey is getting its due,\" she said.\n\n\"When I started playing hockey, the situation was not that great and I had to wait for nine years to get a job. There were some players who were not even sure of getting two square meals a day.\n\n\"But now, the players are able to build houses for their families. They have regular jobs. And even the youngest member of the team is doing well financially and this shows that the sport is actually moving in the right direction.\"\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

                "title": "The Rise of Fact-checking Platforms",
                "body": "You're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nIn March this year, Google said that search trends on misinformation have already recorded an all-time high in India in 2023 (and we're still just in March) which is a clear indication of how much this topic is playing on the minds of Indian users. This rampant spread of fake information has made India a large market for fact-checking businesses today. Some of the platforms in the space include Boom Live, Factly, Newsmeter, SoIndiaEdit, Dfrac, Factcrescend and Youturn.\n\nLarge tech organizations and corporates are also today partnering with third-party fact-checking platforms. For instance, Meta is currently working with independent, IFCN-certified fact-checkers who identify, review and rate viral misinformation across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\n\"Fighting misinformation is an ever-evolving problem, and Meta can't do it alone. We rely on independent fact-checkers to review and rate the accuracy of stories through original reporting, which may include interviewing primary sources, consulting public data and conducting analyses of media, including photos and video,\" the company says in its website.\n\nThe market and business models\n\nIndia is a large market for such fact-checking businesses for several reasons. We are a large population of 1.4bn people which in turn means a very large potential for fact-checking. \"Currently there is a very small number of fact-checkers. It would be less than 20 and there is clearly space for more,\" said Padmaja Ruparel Co-founder IAN and Founding partner IAN Fund.\n\nWith the increasing data clutter, noise and penetration of the internet, the startups solving for fact-checking are expected to grow leaps and bounds. A study by Reuters reveals 63% of Indians count social media as their primary source of news. \"In such scenarios, use cases for such products are numerous like politics, social network, business, sports, entertainment, law enforcement and many more which one may not be able to envision at present,\" said Brijesh Damodaran, Chief Investment Officer & Co-Founder, Auxano Capital.\n\nThe business has broadly 3 stakeholders as customers. Individuals, Businesses and Government. They all require help dealing with the tide of information and the embedded misinformation. Experts say that for the likes of social media players or the portals which offer user-generated content, a plug-in into the mainframe is a business proposition and for other organizations like media a subscription-based business model is being explored. \"For the government, a broader segment needs to be explored wherein the web crawlers can verify the data across the internet. For individual customers, the freemium model can be looked into with 'pay as you use' feature,\" added Damodaran.\n\nOverall, these startups operate in both B2B and B2C models.\n\nInvestor interest and the rise of vernacular\n\nFact-checking as a crowdsourcing service is picking up investor interest but yet there are many unexplored territories of use cases that would require government support. Thus as a category creator we do see investors' interest but the models are yet to show expansion of scope & potential of such businesses and prove positive unit economics for attracting investors to invest growth capital.\n\n\"Fact-checking partners are largely sitting within media organizations or companies like Meta and Google. These are partners helping the larger group/company help fact-check. Further, the Govt. of India, has circulated a draft policy for fact-checking, through PIB. We haven't seen too many investible opportunities in this space,\" said Ruparel.\n\nBut investors expect the rise of vernacular platforms, which is the need of the hour, to bring in investor interest. Since, we are a country of different languages and diverse cultures, it brings its own complexity of cultural/linguistic/religious check on misinformation. This has led to many regional fact-checking platforms. For instance, NewsMeter is a fact checker primarily focused on the southern States in the country.\n\nUse of AI and other trends\n\nAI and blockchain form the foundation for fact-checking tools. \"With the evolution of the industry beginning from crowdsourcing, followed by crowdsourcing + AI, now the industry is finally moving to a fully automated and tech-led model driven by AI,\" said Damodaran.\n\nBlockchain integration is still at a nascent stage due to the generally limited use of blockchain but as the adoption of blockchain technology increases, the fact-checking solutions, experts say, will become more robust and accurate through the blended usage of both AI & Blockchain.\n\nHowever, for now, profitability is one of the biggest challenges as the same has not been showcased so far. Besides, solving for global clients has again been restrictive as these tools require government support to unleash their full potential. \"At the foundational level, the challenge remains with the digitization of information and real-time updation as there exists a lead time which reduces the efficacy of the tool and lastly, with any piece of information containing multiple data points for validation, the biases will prevail over the assessment of the entire information vis-a-vis individual data points,\" he added.\n\n\"Considering the fact, that there is a tremendous amount of misinformation/disinformation circulated through social media, technology will need to play a critical role for fact-checking. These technologies will need to be increasingly developed as the internet accelerates the speed of distribution. In fact, WhatsApp did create technology to restrict the circulation of content (not more than 5 groups, etc.) but there surely is scope for technology to bring real-time verification of content. This will need some deep technology and expertise, especially to ensure fact-checking from a neutral / non-judgemental perspective,\" said Ruparel.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain technology, the application of these tools is expected to become more accurate but will the business model achieve profitability is something that needs to be seen. Experts feel positioning the business toward social impact may yield higher customer and investor interest and so will higher government support in the developing nations.",

                "title": "Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Wagon Imagined As the Ultimate American Family Car",
                "body": "The recently-unveiled 2024 models will be the swansong of the Chevrolet Camaro series, as the bowtie brand has officially confirmed pulling the plug on it. That will happen next January when the nameplate will temporarily be put to sleep but fret not because the moniker will eventually return. 7 photosPhoto: Instagram | tuningcar_ps \"While there is no immediate successor, this is not the end of the Camaro's story,\" Chevrolet announced earlier this year. You're probably curious about the next generation, and the truth is that no one with no direct ties to its development knows anything about it. Still, logic tells us that it will at least launch with battery-electric power.\n\nIt has been reported that it could morph into a four-door with an all-quiet powertrain (or more), and others speak of the Camaro being turned into a sub-brand that might comprise crossovers with two and four doors and a flagship sports model. The GM-owned company has also confirmed electric \"low-roof entries\" for the near future, and that term could apply to two-door coupes and convertibles, sports cars, and sedans.\n\nChevy seems interested in most body styles, bar a station wagon, and who can blame them? After all, not many new car buyers are willing to spend their hard-earned money on a low-slung model with five doors, as they'd rather get a crossover or an SUV instead. As a result, we can say that an estate version of the Camaro will never happen until the high-riding vehicle frenzy dies anyway. And by the looks of it, we won't see one in our lifetimes.\n\nBut while a five-door variant of the muscle car is a far stretch in the real world, it already exists in Fantasy Land. These renderings came from tuningcar_ps on Instagram, and imagine the model in two configurations. The white copy is a normal version of the Camaro, whereas the blue one is in the range-topping flavor that adds the ZL1 suffix, featuring a sportier design, larger wheels, beefier brakes, chassis enhancements, and a serious engine under the hood. The small block V8, a 6.2-liter supercharged mill, develops 650 hp and 650 lb-ft (881 Nm) of torque.\n\nTo come up with the new design, the rendering artist used the body of the five-door Chrysler 300. From here on, they proceeded to give it the same profile styling as that of the Camaro, joined by the face of the real muscle car. For a more serious presence, the chrome trim was blacked out entirely, and due to the obvious suspension modifications, the Camaro ZL1 wagon sits closer to the ground. If it's one thing that we're not fans of when it comes to this CGI redesign, it is the rear wing decorating the tailgate of the range-topper. Other than that, we think it looks good, and we'd consider buying one if they gave it a shot. But would you do that?\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by ???? T??I?????_??????

                "body": "This June saw plenty of exciting horological news, including Dubai Watch Week and Watches and Wonders fairs in Dubai and Shanghai, respectively, after Patek Philippe’s Grand Exhibition in Tokyo\n\nGirard-Perregaux worked with Saint Laurent to update the Casquette; Hublot celebrated Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic with a Spirit of Big Bang Tourbillon; and Bremont is anticipating the upcoming F1\n\nHigh horology kept busy around the world as Dubai Watch Week and Watches and Wonders announced new fairs later in the year in Dubai and Shanghai respectively. Patek Philippe just concluded its exhibition in Tokyo, showcasing its entire collection as well as six stunning new releases, while Rihanna wore a watch choker at Louis Vuitton’s Paris Fashion Week show.\n\nMeanwhile, Bremont, Audemars Piguet, Girard-Perregaux and more brands released new pieces borne out of collaborations, and Phillips just sold one of the most important pocket watches in horology at record price.\n\nThese were the biggest timepiece moments in June …1. Conventions to watch\n\nCelebrations of high horology continue around the world as this month, Dubai Watch Week and Watches and Wonders made announcements for fairs in the foreseeable future.\n\nFounded in 2015, Dubai Watch Week is slated to take place between November 16 and 20 at the Dubai International Financial Centre. The fair recently announced that it expects to feature upwards of 55 brands in this year’s edition, including Audemars Piguet, Biver, F.P. Journe, Greubel Forsey and more.Inside LeBron James’ impressive luxury watch collection\n\nGeneva-based Watches and Wonders had a nice few months to breathe after its annual Geneva edition in early April, but is now keen to keep the ball rolling in Shanghai as it announced this month that the fair will return to the city for the third time between September 13 and 17.\n\nThe fair plans to host 14 brands at the Pavilion of the West Bund Art Center. What’s more, the event will be opening to the public for the first time on the last two days of the run, for which tickets will go in August for US$20 (150 RMB) per head via a WeChat mini-programme.2. Choking on their aspirations\n\nSpeaking of Watches and Wonders, one of the biggest trends to come from the Geneva edition of the fair was the resurgence of the sautoir or secret necklace/wristwatch. The trend itself stems from a somewhat problematic history when women were not expected to be checking the time during social functions, so they opted for timepieces that appeared to be nothing more than dazzling jewels.\n\nNowadays, wearing a watch anywhere other than the wrist is a fashion and jewellery statement as much as it is a horological one. Brands from both sides (like Van Cleef & Arpels, and Jaeger-LeCoultre) design pieces specifically to be worn on the neck rather than on the wrist.\n\nWe’re not sure whether Rihanna was intentionally channelling this trend with her latest horological choice, but she definitely made a splash regardless. The long-time friend of Jacob & Co. wore a 47mm Brilliant Flying Tourbillon set with 338 baguette-cut white diamonds on her neck to complement her all-denim outfit at the Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week on June 20; incidentally, Pharrell’s first as creative director and head of menswear at the brand.10 most popular luxury brands in the world, ranked – but which is No 1?\n\nFans quickly praised Rihanna’s move and are now wondering one thing only – is the “watch choker” here to stay?3. Patek Philippe’s grand exhibition\n\nBack on this side of the globe, Swiss high horology maison Patek Philippe pulled out all the stops for the sixth edition of its Grand Exhibition “Watch Art”, which was held in Tokyo between June 10 to 25.\n\nThe maison took over the Sumitomo Sankaku Hiroba glass skyscraper to host the free-of-charge exhibition, which was separated into 10 themed areas and brought together 500 timepieces and objects, including all of Patek Philippe’s current collection and 190 pieces from the brand’s museum in Geneva.\n\nFor those of us who weren’t there, the next best piece of news was the release of six limited-edition pieces to commemorate the event. In addition to two pastel colourways for the sub-seconds Calatrava, the maison released the salmon-dialled 42mm Tokyo 2023 Quadruple Complication. Cased in platinum, the 5308P-010 combines a minute repeater, split second chronograph and perpetual calendar with moonphase.\n\nTo fully represent Tokyo, the house also released a luscious purple World Time 5330G-010 with a date complication synchronised to Tokyo, necessitating the new 240 HU C calibre, and a World Time Minute Repeater 5531R-014 that features a cloisonné enamel depiction of the Chuo ward in Tokyo. Rounding out the six releases is the refined ladies’ moonphase model ref. 7121/200G-010.Where to buy new and pre-owned Rolexes online: 6 most trustworthy sources4. Time to be better together\n\nPatek Philippe wasn’t the only brand that was busy this month, as major names throughout the industry released stunning pieces, most in cross-industry collaborations. Girard-Perregaux worked with Saint Laurent to update the Casquette, an uber-sci-fi watch design now in scratch-resistant ceramic and titanium.\n\nAudemars Piguet released its second Royal Oak Concept Tourbillon in collaboration with Marvel featuring Spider-Man after its Black Panther release in 2021. Hublot took a left and commemorated the return of the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic at Liberty State Park in New York with a Spirit of Big Bang Tourbillon with a five-day power reserve.\n\nMeanwhile, Bremont, Richard Mille and Rolex opted to deepen their ties with racing rather than fashion or comics. UK-based Bremont released a new WR-45 limited edition piece and a new C-type tribute for the brand’s Jaguar collection. The former launch is to commemorate the upcoming 77th Formula One Aramco British Grand Prix and Silverstone in collaboration with Williams Racing, while the latter sports an embossed classic Jaguar logo in celebration of the 70th anniversary of Jaguar’s 1953 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nRolex and Richard Mille celebrated Le Mans in their own way, releasing a discreet red-accented Cosmograph Daytona, and a limited-edition white-and-green RM72-01 Le Mans Classic flyback chronograph also with red accents both in commemoration of the endurance race’s centenary.5. Roger Smith No 2 sets an auction record\n\nIt feels like every auction these days adds record-breaking pieces to the all-time list, but few are as exceptional and momentous as Roger Smith’s Pocket Watch No 2 fetching US$4.9 million (£3.8 million) at Phillips’ New York Watch Auction: Eight this month.Ivanka Trump or Kate Middleton – who wore the Lotus Lady dress better?\n\nHailing from Manchester, horologist Roger W. Smith first rose to prominence as an apprentice of the legendary George Daniels. His most notable achievements include the Daniels Method of mastering over 30 different skills so that a single watchmaker can hand-make a watch from start to finish; and the invention of the coaxial escapement, which is used most widely in Omega’s collections including the Speedmaster.\n\nSmith dubbed Pocket Watch No 2 “the most important watch I’ve made, without a doubt”, per Phillips. His first attempt and submission to Daniels in 1990 was entirely handmade, with a tourbillon and spring detent escapement and twin barrels, but Daniels dubbed it “not up to scratch”, telling the then-22-year-old Smith that “watches should appear ‘created’ rather than ‘handmade’.”\n\nSmith spent five years on this second attempt, and when No 2 was finished, Daniels told Smith, “You are now a watchmaker.”\n\nDaniels himself has several pieces among the most expensive at auction, most notably his Yellow Gold Space Traveller’s I and II pocket watches both entirely handmade in 1982 with chronograph and moonphase complications. The two pieces were both sold by Sotheby’s in London for US$4.5 million (£3.6 million) in 2019 and US$3.9 million (£3.1 million) in 2017, respectively.\n\nWant more stories like this?

                "body": "SEOUL, June 30 (Yonhap) -- With Cheong Wa Dae having served as the office and residential compound for 12 former South Korean presidents, one tradition remained constant: planting commemorative trees at the compound.\n\nThere are 35 such trees planted by the presidents who have ruled the country.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced Friday it will offer a guided tour of presidential trees starting the following day as part of its year-round program to mark the first anniversary of opening up the compound to public access.\n\nThe move followed the relocation of the presidential office by President Yoon Suk Yeol to a former government building south of Cheong Wa Dae in the capital in May last year.\n\nParticipants in the program can see 10 trees selected from the 35 while hearing intriguing stories related to the presidents who planted them from a guide, according to the ministry.\n\nThe guidance will be provided based on \"Cheong Wa Dae's Trees,\" a 2022 book written by Park Sang-jin, an honorary professor at Kyungpook National University and the country's top expert on trees in the compound.\n\nThe tradition of planting trees at Cheong Wa Dae started with former President Rhee Syng-man in March 1960. Since then, numerous presidents have continued the tradition, ranging from planting commemorative trees to incorporating trees into the landscape design.\n\nDuring a press tour of the program, Park stated that Rhee is presumed to have planted many fir trees across the country while in office, apparently to promote the nationwide forestation campaign led by the government. This campaign was under way as about half of the mountains in the country remained treeless after the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nHowever, the 25-meter-high fir tree, slightly over 70 years old, located in the valley near the Sangchunjae building at Cheong Wa Dae, is now the only remaining commemorative tree planted by the former president, as the rest were destroyed during the war, according to Park.\n\nWith its wooden plate rotted away, the professor had a hard time locating the whereabouts of the tree inside the compound. But a photo from the National Archives provided a decisive clue, he said.\n\n\"I'm really happy to find the only tree of President Rhee,\" he said proudly.\n\nFormer President Roh Tae-woo planted a Korean fir tree in the space between the main building and the grand garden on Arbor Day in 1988, bidding the country a successful hosting of the Seoul Olympics that was held later that year. He apparently believed the tree would bring fortune to the country as its scientific name, \"Abies koreana,\" includes the word \"koreana,\" Park said.\n\nFormer President Kim Dae-jung planted a mugunghwa, or the rose of Sharon, tree at a garden in front of the Yeongbingwan state guest house after returning from the first inter-Korean summit in June 2000 in Pyongyang to mark the event. Park said the president apparently wanted to put an emphasis on patriotism following the historic summit talks through the choice of the country's national flower.\n\nAlso among the trees planted by former presidents are a torulosa tree planted by Park Chung-hee, a white pine tree by Chun Doo-hwan, a dogwood tree by Kim Young-sam, a pine tree by Roh Moo-hyun, a mugunghwa tree by Lee Myung-bak, a fringe tree by Park Geun-hye and a camellia by Moon Jae-in.\n\nOf the 12 former presidents who resided at Cheong Wa Dae, President Yun Bo-sun is the only one without a memorial tree. President Choi Kyu-hah's memorial tree was excluded from the tour because it is located outside the area that is open to the public, according to the ministry.\n\nThe one-hour tour will be offered twice a day, except Tuesdays when Cheong Wa Dae closes -- at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. The tour starts at the Sangchunjae building and concludes at Yeongbingwan. All visitors to Cheong Wa Dae can participate in the program without a reservation.",

During a recent interview, Kiara poked fun at Kartik by mentioning that his producers have a tradition of gifting him a car whenever his movies become successful.\n\nIn an interview with Mirchi Plus, Kiara hilariously pointed at Kartik's T-shirt, which had a car print on it and said, \"That's a sign. Because you know right, whenever Kartik's film is a blockbuster, his producers gift him a car.\" Kartik's reply left the interviewer in splits. He said, \"That's why my name is Car-tik.\"\n\nTalking about the gift, Kartik said that Bhushan had gifted him a car after the success of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. Further looking at the car print on his T-shirt, Kartik said, \"I hope I get this car after the success of Satyaprem Ki Katha.\"\n\nAfter the success of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Kartik Aaryan took to his Instagram handle and dropped pictures of his new car - McLaren GT. The car, which approximately costs Rs 4.7 crore, was gifted to him by Bhushan Kumar.\n\nTalking about the gift, Bhushan Kumar had said, \"His dedication to each project is commendable. This sports car is a token of appreciation for his hard work and grit. We instill confidence in him, and we aim to strengthen this collaboration in the future.\"",

                "title": "Colonies de vacances : 10 réponses aux questions de parents",
                "body": "Les vacances scolaires, et notamment celles de l'été, sont l'occasion pour les parents de laisser partir leurs enfants en colonie de vacances, soit en France ou à l'étranger. Ce type de séjour, loin du domicile familial, a plusieurs avantages pour un enfant et un ado : il permet de renforcer ses capacités d'autonomie, de socialisation et d'apprendre les règles de la vie en communauté. Les enfants en reviennent généralement grandis, épanouis, avec pleins de souvenirs en tête et de nouveaux amis.\n\nC'est souvent à l'adolescence que les parents envoient leurs enfants pour la première fois en colonies de vacances. Mais certaines sont accessibles dès l'âge de 4 ans. Bien entendu, cela dépend aussi de votre jugement : si vous trouvez que votre enfant est trop jeune pour partir en colonie, libres à vous de lui proposer les années suivantes, quand il sera plus âgé.\n\nLe prix moyen d'une colonie de vacances est de 550 euros par semaine, selon l'étude Ifop commandée par l'association La Jeunesse en plein air et publiée en mai 2019. En général, le coût varie par rapport à la durée du séjour, mais aussi selon l'offre des activités proposées et du lieu de destination de vacances.\n\nIl existe des aides pour financer une colonie de vacances. La Caisse d'allocations familiales (CAF) accorde l'AVE (Aides Vacances Enfants), qui fait partie des aides Vacaf, aux familles allocataires dont les enfants sont âgés de 7 à 16 ans. L'agence nationale pour le chèque-vacances (ANCV) propose aux organismes en contact avec des publics fragiles soit l'aide aux projets vacances, soit la bourse solidarité (BSV) qui permet de financer tout ou une partie d'un séjour de vacances en France et en Europe.\n\nLes comités d'entreprise peuvent avoir des bons ou des chèques-vacances, des politiques tarifaires, des actions tarifaires avec des associations. Certaines associations caritatives peuvent aussi aider les familles modestes ou défavorisées à financer les vacances de leurs enfants.\n\nEn France, il existe plusieurs organismes de colonies de vacances, parmi lesquels on retrouve :\n\nPour choisir une colonie de vacances pour son enfant, il faut avant tout savoir quelles sont ses envies. Il a envie de partir en France ou à l'étranger, de faire un séjour sportif ou au cœur de la nature ? Pour éviter toutes déceptions, n'hésitez pas à lui demander ce qui lui plaît et axez vos recherches en fonction de ses attentes. Ce qui est sûr, c'est que plus votre enfant sera impliqué dans le choix de sa colo, plus son séjour lui plaira ! Évidemment, le rythme de la colonie doit bien être adapté à son âge et à son degré d'autonomie.\n\nUne colonie de vacances est un séjour qui se fait en groupe au sein d'une structure d'accueil collectif. Les enfants sont généralement logés par chambre de 2 à 6 lits. Toutefois, les enfants bénéficient de temps libres qui leur permettent de se retrouver seuls s'ils le souhaitent.\n\nSelon les différentes colonies de vacances proposées, les hébergements peuvent être différents. Bien souvent, les enfants sont tous entre eux, répartis par tranches d'âge. Ils prennent également leurs repas tous ensemble pour favoriser la cohésion de groupe. Diverses activités rythment la journée des petits vacanciers selon le thème de la colonie choisie : sports, randonnées, arts, cours de langues, animations ludiques, éducatives et pédagogiques.\n\nDans une colonie, le nombre d'animateurs varie selon l'âge des enfants. Pour les encadrer, il faut qu'il y ait au minimum un animateur pour 8 enfants s'ils ont moins de 6 ans, et un animateur pour 12 enfants s'ils ont 6 ans et plus. Dans tous les cas, les enfants sont encadrés par un personnel qualifié, salarié ou bénévole, âgé d'au moins 16 ans, qui a soit un brevet d'aptitude (Bafa, BAFD) ou une qualification certifiée par leur statut d'agent public relevant de l'animation.\n\nAvant le départ en colonie de vacances, préparez rigoureusement les affaires de votre enfant, qui varient évidemment en fonction de la durée, de la nature et de la destination du séjour. Généralement, l'organisme de la colonie vous transmet, quelques semaines avant le départ, une liste d'affaire à prendre pour le séjour. Soyez attentive aux recommandations concernant :\n\nLa communication avec les parents est maintenue durant un séjour en colonie de vacances. Les parents peuvent disposer du numéro du directeur et le siège de la colonie est là pour répondre aux questions. Parfois, une plage horaire est aménagée pour vous permettre de communiquer avec vos enfants.\n\nS'il s'agit d'une colonie itinérante, n'hésitez pas à demander une feuille de route détaillée et, un numéro de téléphone ainsi qu'une adresse postale si vous souhaitez envoyer du courrier à votre enfant.\n\nVous êtes stressée à l'idée de laisser partir votre enfant ? Lui aussi appréhende de partir loin de vous ? C'est tout à fait normal ! Avant le départ, essayez de le rassurer en valorisant au maximum les vacances qu'il s'apprête à vivre, en l'informant sur la date de retour et comment vous viendrez le chercher.\n\nVous pouvez également lui confier un objet qui vous appartient (un foulard, une photo...) et qu'il pourra serrer bien fort s'il se sent mal durant le séjour. Pensez aussi à lui dire que le contact ne sera pas rompu, que vous pourrez communiquer dès qu'il en ressent le besoin.",

                "title": "Preeti Jhangiani makes big screen comeback",
                "body": "Preeti Jhangiani is back after a long hiatus with Mahapaur, a political drama.\n\nRemember the softspoken, pretty girl, Kiran, in Mohabbatein? Well, that was debutante Preeti Jhangiani, who later worked in films like LOC Kargil, Aan: Men at Work and other such movies before taking a long hiatus. Preeti is now busy with back-to-back projects apart from being actively involved in Pro Panja League founded by her and her husband Parvin Dabas. The actress speaks about her upcoming film Mahapaur, and what kept her busy all this while.\n\nWhat made you say yes to Mahapaur?\n\nMahapaur will most probably see a theatrical release. It is a movie based on Lucknow politics and I play the protagonist, the mayor of the city. It is a very different role for me as the audience will get to see me reprise a grey character, which is fictional but very close to reality. We shot the film entirely in Lucknow in real locations. It addresses a very real, relevant issue, which is the degradation of the environment and how corruption in politics is not only affecting the middle class but also the environment.\n\nHow did you prepare for the role?\n\nI have depended completely on my director Avinash Gupta and his vision as he has grown up in Lucknow. But yes, we are not here to portray politics or politicians in a negative light. It is very important to state that in any democracy and governance, a very delicate balance is needed for any person in power. For a few weeks, I practised my dialogues so that they genuinely sound like a person who is used to being in power.\n\nWhat made you stay away from film industry for long?\n\nI don't think I stayed away. I was connected to my fans and audience through my events and shows. But the films I was being offered did not excite me. So I waited for the right project.\n\nHow did this interest in arm wrestling grow?\n\nThe idea of an arm wrestling league was my husband Parvin Dabas' idea. But we nurtured the vision together. My company, Swen Entertainment, runs a lot of digital websites on sports like The MMA India Show, the Sports India Show and such, and we were always into sports. When we decided on sports promotion, we wanted to go with a sport which had less support. Also, arm wrestling or panja has its roots set deep in India and we were sure it could be a hugely popular sport.\n\nHow have you been balancing your films and official work for Pro Panja League?\n\nIt is a balancing act and requires a lot of planning. But I feel every woman is a multitasker and can do a lot of things at one time! Don't forget, I am also a mother of two boys!\n\nWhat keeps you busy when not working?\n\nMy two boys, Jaiveer (12) and Dev (8). It's a lot of work and a big responsibility to raise the two.\n\nHow do you wish to support the arm wrestlers?\n\nWe are giving them a huge platform with the Pro Panja League. We have taught them to grow their social media numbers, and many of them are popular now -- getting jobs, training opportunities and so on. Being on Sony Sports with the Pro Panja League will get them both money and fame!\n\nHow do you keep fit?\n\nOne hour of any activity like walking or yoga or functional training every day; eating in moderation and staying away from junk food.",

                "title": "Asus Vivobook 15 OLED review: Pros, Cons, and Verdict",
                "body": "The Asus Vivobook 15 OLED is meant for students and working professionals who have light to moderate usage. It is clearly not a gaming machine.\n\nPros: Vibrant OLED display, Smooth performance, Full-sized keyboard, Privacy shutter for camera, Fingerprint scanner.\n\nCons: Thermals, Average speakers, Average battery life.\n\nAsus Vivobook laptops generally offer a value-for-money package. That's because these laptops come with an overall good specs sheet. We get the latest chipset, a vibrant panel, and even a dedicated fingerprint scanner in some models. Some of that is rare to get in budget laptops but Asus does it. This time, it appears to have done it again. The Taiwanese giant has launched a host of Vivobook laptops in different sizes and we've already reviewed some.\n\nOne of the interesting laptops that many may consider this year when purchasing a 15-inch machine is the Asus Vivobook 15 OLED. Just as its name says, it's a laptop with an OLED display. Not just that, it is powered by the latest Intel i5 processor and has some other cool features. We took the Vivobook 15 OLED for a spin and have enjoyed using it. But how's the laptop for students, video editors, and gamers? Let's have a practical look at the machine.\n\nBefore we start with the review, let's see its specs sheet.\n\nThe Vivobook 15 OLED is a sleek 15-inch machine that weighs 1.70kg and is made out of plastic. Despite being plastic, the matte finish on the lid doesn't make it look tacky. Asus probably went with this material to keep the cost down while giving the latest hardware.\n\nAlthough the finish on the lid is matte, it still catches fingerprints that are hard to remove. You really need a microfibre cloth to get fingerprints and smudges away, at least on the Black variant.\n\nThe laptop has a 180-degree hinge, meaning you can lay down the display and view content, in case that's what you were thinking. It has a thin-bezel display with Asus branding at the bottom just where the screen ends and a camera on the top for video calls and meetings. Asus has offered a full-sized keyboard that includes num keys. It's good to see that Asus didn't waste the space it had.\n\nBelow the keyboard is the extra-large trackpad and it holds a fingerprint scanner for one-touch login. Moving to the sides, there are dual air vents on the left spine to keep the heat out of the machine. It is followed by a USB Type-A port that has USB 2.0 speeds.\n\nAsus has offered an AC port for charging, an HDMI port, two USB ports with USB 3.2 speeds, a Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the right side. There's no SD card reader here, which means you have to rely on a dongle.\n\nThe laptop sports a 15-inch glossy display that's sharp and vibrant. As the name suggests, it's an OLED panel that offers saturated colors and is slightly on the warmer side. So you may not be able to properly color grade videos in editing software, but you'd surely enjoy movies on this one.\n\nIt has a 60Hz refresh rate which means it's definitely not a proper gaming laptop. However, as said above, it is a great panel for binge-watching sessions. I watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, just before the release of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and it was a good experience.\n\nThe screen has 600 nits of peak brightness for HDR content, but even on SDR on maximum brightness, I didn't face any issues seeing the content on the screen. However, I did notice some glare since it's a glossy panel.\n\nThe Vivobook 15 OLED packs the latest hardware from Intel. It is powered by an Intel i5-13500H which makes daily tasks on the laptop as smooth as possible. Since it's an H-series processor, the laptop steps further and allows you to edit videos and also play some games.\n\nSpeaking of editing, you'll be able to run apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premier Pro. However, for graphical tasks, it may take some time to render since it doesn't have a dedicated GPU. The laptop has Intel Iris Xe graphics, which helps in doing light graphics tasks and light gaming.\n\nThat said, the laptop is not meant for gamers but rather for students and professionals. Those who want to write content, jot notes, edit photos and videos to some extent, and attend online classes will thoroughly enjoy using this machine. And of course, binge-watchers will love watching movies and shows on the laptop.\n\nIn my day-to-day usage, which involved writing content, watching YouTube videos, and editing photos, the laptop performed fairly well. It has 16GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3200Mhz. So it can handle multiple tabs.\n\nWhen I am working, I keep at least 10-12 tabs open in the background, and this machine can easily handle that. On Cinebench R23, the laptop was able to score points closer to the 1800s in the single-core department and around 6200 in the multi-core department.\n\nThere's a Dynamic Performance mode in the MyASUS app that allows the machine to run at its best. So expect slightly better performance with this mode as compared to the standard mode. It goes without saying that you must have the laptop plugged into power when doing intense tasks like video editing or even light gaming to get the best results.\n\nOne thing to note here is that the laptop heats even though it has dual vents for thermals. The fans make loud noise even though Asus says they are 'quieter and faster'. Overall, the thermals on his one aren't that great. So using it for light to moderate tasks is what we recommend.\n\nIt has 512GB of PCIe Gen 3 storage, which is not the latest but still fast. If 512GB is not enough, Asus has kept an M.2 2280 slot empty that can hold up to PCIe 4.0 storage. The RAM can also be expanded using the extra DDR4 SO-DIMM slot.\n\nNow about the keyboard, it's a pretty good chicklet-style keyboard with a 1.4mm key travel. It has dished key caps sized 0.2mm that help users type better. Interestingly, it also comes with a numpad, which is definitely useful for some including me.\n\nMoving to the trackpad, it works like it should but it doesn't offer satisfying clicks. Sometimes it's a bit squeaky. Nonetheless, it works and since it has an extra-large size (128.9mm x 73.2mm), you can move your finger freely. The trackpad also holds a fingerprint scanner, which works accurately.\n\nYou can either keep a fingerprint lock, allowing for a one-touch login, or set up facial recognition. The latter can be done with the help of the webcam. It has a 3DNR webcam that enhances the overall video. And by the way, the webcam has 720p resolution. Asus has also offered a privacy shutter to help with privacy. The laptop also has a microphone with AI noise cancelation support.\n\nThe device packs a 50Whr 3-cell battery that offers an average battery life on moderate to heavy usage. It can get you around 4-5 hours with moderate usage. Charging it to the brim is quick since it comes with 65W fast charging support. What's great is that the charging adapter is compact and lightweight as opposed to the adapters of laptops from other OEMs. This makes it mobile and travel-friendly.\n\nApart from this, Asus has other features like SonicMaster sound via the speaker setup, which I found to be average. Then, there's Asus Antimicrobial Guard Plus, which is said to inhibit viruses and bacteria.\n\nThe laptop has a total of seven different ports. This includes three USB Type-A ports, two having USB 3.2 speeds and one featuring USB 2.0 speed. There's a USB Type-C port, HDMI, and audio jack. All ports work as intended.\n\nIt has Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 and I had no issues with both connectivity options. My Wi-Fi never disconnected and offered the desired speeds. The TWS earbuds I connected worked like they should.\n\nThe laptop boots on Windows 11 Home Edition, which has most of the features users require. It comes with a couple of built-in apps such as MyASUS, ScreenXpert, and GlideX. Asus has also taken care of the build since it had MIL-STD 810H certification.\n\nOther than the performance bit, the laptop comes with a 1-year warranty, which can be extended up to 2 years (starting at Rs 99) when purchasing the laptop. In the box, the laptop comes with a compact charging adapter, a power cable, and a bunch of paperwork.\n\nThe Asus Vivobook 15 OLED is overall a good laptop for students and professionals. It has a vibrant panel, smooth day-to-day performance, and even comes with added features like a privacy shutter and fingerprint scanner.\n\nTo put it simply, if your workload is light to moderate and you don't want to game, this is the Asus laptop to consider for Rs 74,999. However, if gaming is what you want or want to do graphical tasks like video editing, then you can look for a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n\nBut mostly, you'd miss out on an OLED panel and lose out in the weight department since most laptops with a dedicated GPU are closer to 2 KGs.",

While many football fans are familiar with his on-field achievements, there are several lesser-known aspects of his life. In this article, we explore 13 intriguing facts about the German that shed light on his upbringing, interests, and character.\n\nGrowing up in Germany, Havertz supported his local club, Alemannia Aachen. Despite their short-lived stint in the Bundesliga, he and his family remained dedicated fans, and Kai later joined the club's academy in 2009.\n\n🔴⚫ Kai Havertz (21, Attacking Midfielder): Discovered by Bayer 04 Leverkusen and brought for FREE from Alemannia Aachen.\n\n🔴⚫ Florian Wirtz (18, Attacking Midfielder): Discovered by Bayer 04 Leverkusen and brought for €200K from FC Köln.\n\nThe future of Germany. 😍 pic.twitter.com/MtLGUvTTVT\n\n-- Pro Future Stars (@ProFutureStars1) June 9, 2021\n\nWhile admiring Ronaldinho, Iniesta, Zidane, and Kaka, Havertz also held former Liverpool striker Erik Meijer in high regard. Meijer played for Liverpool between 1999 and 2000 and was a key player for Alemannia Aachen when Kai was a regular spectator.\n\nHavertz's rapid rise to prominence included a dramatic debut for Bayer Leverkusen. Urged to join the team on short notice due to an injured player, he made his first appearance in the 83rd minute of a match against Werder Bremen.\n\nDuring his time at Bayer Leverkusen, the German interantional broke several records. Although some have been surpassed since, he remains the youngest player to reach 100 Bundesliga appearances. He also holds the record for the most goals by a teenager in a German top-flight season.\n\nIn his debut season with Leverkusen, Havertz had to juggle football and school exams, resulting in him missing matches. Despite the challenges, he managed to balance his studies in sports, German, geography, and math with his football commitments.\n\nOne of the matches that he missed was a round of 16 Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid in 2017. How much it would have sucked!\n\nHavertz made his Champions League debut at Wembley Stadium when he was just 17 years old, playing for Leverkusen against Tottenham Hotspur.

Seeking a calming activity away from the sport, he chose to learn the instrument and aspires to master both classical and modern music.\n\nKai Havertz - a very talented man.\n\nFull video 🎹: https://t.co/WYMgxJpAAm pic.twitter.com/2NiVIMQwEB\n\n-- Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) April 25, 2020\n\nHavertz has always been an animal lover, having owned various pets during his childhood. His affinity for donkeys began when his parents gifted him a stuffed toy as a child. He now actively participates in rescuing and caring for donkeys at a sanctuary near his childhood home.\n\nHavertz's affinity for the number 29 stems from his video gaming experiences with his brother, Jan. When asked to choose a shirt number upon turning professional, he opted for 29 to honor the tradition they had established.\n\nKai Havertz's kit numbers throughout his career:\n\nBayer Leverkusen - #29\n\nChelsea - #29\n\nArsenal - #29\n\nKeeping the 2️⃣9️⃣ tradition going. 😅 #afc pic.twitter.com/xwll9OPwXn\n\n-- afcstuff (@afcstuff) June 28, 2023\n\nHavertz's move to Chelsea in 2020 made him the most expensive German player of all time, with a reported fee of £72 million. This surpassed the previous record set by Timo Werner, who also moved from the Bundesliga to Chelsea.\n\nCommitted to giving back to the community, the midfielder established his own charity in March. The foundation aims to support individuals with disabilities or illnesses, rescue neglected animals, and promote sport as a means of personal development.\n\nBy signing for Arsenal, Havertz becomes the 12th German player to represent the club's men's first-team. This prestigious group includes notable names such as Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski, and Per Mertesacker, who have all made significant contributions to the club.\n\nSick of transfer news ???

In Europe, Middle East and Africa sales increased 3%.\n\nThe company's shares were last down about 4% in extended hours in choppy trading.\n\nNext year, the environment is going to continue to be promotional which puts pressure on wholesale partners in terms of how they manage through the first half of the year, CEO John Donahoe said on an earnings call.\n\nPeer Under Armour forecast annual sales and profit below Wall Street estimates in May due to waning demand and higher discounts.\n\nNike's gross margin fell 140 basis points to 43.6% in the reported quarter on efforts to clear excess inventory through more promotions and discounts at a time when the industry is being squeezed by higher supply chain, input and labor costs.\n\n\"Given the customer is being quite cautious in at least two regions which are quite significant to Nike, gross margins are expected to still be hit as they continue promotions to try getting customer's attention,\" said Jane Hali & Associates senior analyst Jessica Ramirez.\n\nGreater China was a bright spot as sales jumped 16% jump following the reversal of the rigid zero-Covid-19 policy. Sales in the region had declined in the first three quarters.\n\nNike expects first-quarter reported revenue growth to be flat to up low-single digit, compared with analysts' average expectation of 5.8% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe company expects full-year reported revenue to rise mid-single-digits, compared with analysts expectations of a revenue of a 6.3% rise.\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $12.83 billion and beat estimates of $12.59 billion, while earnings per share of 66 cents missed estimates by a cent.",

Altino dos Santos Thursday suggested the creation of the National Maritime High Authority (AAMN) to facilitate the coordination of actions in favour of national interest.\n\nGeneral Altino dos Santos stressed the importance of AAMN at the conference on \"national and regional maritime security, ahead of 47 anniversary of the Angolan Navy (MGA), scheduled for July 10.\n\nAddressing the event, under the topic: perspectives in the face of new threats\",\n\nthe General Altino dos Santos said the creation of AAMN will ensure safety and control of navigation, preservation of natural resources.\n\nThe move will also ensure protection of underwater cultural heritage as well as the marine environment and prevention and combat of pollution.\n\nHe hopes that the body will also have, among its responsibilities, maritime signaling and navigational aids, inspection of the economic use of resources, protection of mangroves, maritime rescue and on the coastline and public health, as well as the fight against drug trafficking, terrorism, piracy and illegal migration.\n\nThe FAA Chief of General Staff assured that the Navy is in better conditions to carry out its role of defending the maritime space from any aggression.\n\nHe stated that it is prepared, in coordination with the other branches of the FAA, to ensure that there is a blue, clean, safe sea, with plenty of food and wealth for the people and a leverage factor for the national economy.\n\nHe said that MGA can be proud that, in addition to the new ships and those that will gradually arrive in the country, a significant part of the works of expansion and modernisation of the naval base of Soyo, the largest in infrastructure of the branch, since the National Independence, will be concluded.\n\nHe defended a permanent inspection of the oceans to avoid shortages of fish products and less income for the national economy.\n\nThe General stressed that unreported and unregulated illegal fishing constitutes a serious threat to economic sovereignty and to the population, and therefore must be fought.\n\nGeneral Altino dos Santos advocated the need to publicise, from an early age, the Angolan maritime potential among national citizens, regarding leisure capacity, clean beaches, blue waters, water sports, the need to preserve the environment, and its economic advantages.\n\nThe Chief of Staff praised the country's efforts towards the decarbonisation of the environment, the reconstitution of the coastal ecosystem, with the massive planting of mangroves, important for capturing carbon and releasing oxygen, as well as being a place for the reproduction of species.\n\nIn his speech on \"operational perspectives on maritime security\", the commander of the Angolan Navy (MGA), Admiral Valentim António, considered international cooperation essential to guarantee the safety and protection of the seas.\n\nIn turn, the Admiral Valentim António pointed out as the main challenges the fight against piracy and smuggling of human beings, drugs and weapons to guarantee the safety of the seas and avoid negative repercussions on the economies of the States.",

                "title": "10 Reasons To Choose The GR Corolla Over The Volkswagen Golf R",
                "body": "The Toyota GR Corolla is a Volkswagen Golf R beater with a three-cylinder heart.\n\nLong has the Volkswagen Golf R been the everyday driver's ultra rapid hot hatch of choice. Sure, the talented Audi RS3 is faster, but then it costs a ridiculous amount of money to buy and run. And whereas the Honda Civic Type R is a track slaying beast, driving one every day will keep your chiropractor in business.\n\nvideo of the day Ford Mustang 2024 Price Just Announced - the Dark Horse Cost is shocking\n\nThis though is all about to change, as the magnificent Toyota GR Corolla makes its presence felt. Exploding onto the scene with a screaming exhaust, the Japanese creation has most rival hot hatches running for the hills. Deeply talented, fantastic to drive and a little bonkers to look at, the Toyota GR Corolla is a snarling breath of force inducted air.\n\nWith a legion of fans at their helms, there are plenty of Volkswagen Golf R designated vehicles out there. But read on to see why there are 10 Reasons To Choose The GR Corolla Over The Volkswagen Golf R.\n\n10 A GR Badge Is Where It Is At\n\nThe Volkswagen R designation has been attached to some of the fiercest VW group offerings in recent years, with the Golf R getting all the limelight. It's a polished package that attracts a lot of buyers, but the recipe has pretty much stayed the same. And it's getting a little bland.\n\nSwapping the R for a GR seems the logical step. The GR moniker is fresher, more alluring, and its emergence more recent. It's essentially the new kid on the block, bringing with it a funkier-kudos, and some fire back to the Toyota brand. It's the hip new thing and very exciting.\n\nPros\n\n1. The GR range of cars are pumping life back into performance Toyota's.\n\n2. Toyota fans now have their own dedicated sports badge range.\n\n3. So far, the GR cars have been outstanding offerings.\n\nCons\n\n1. GR range is not as established as the Volkswagen R range.\n\n2. The Volkswagen Golf R is so polished, it's near perfect.\n\n3. In comparison to a GR following, the Volkswagen R fan base is simply massive.\n\n9 A GR Corolla Looks Much Better Than A Golf R\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R is a do-it-all vehicle. It's a car that has been designed and styled to appeal to a huge range of buyers, and in doing so, Volkswagen hasn't been very adventurous in the flair department. The Golf R wears a smart suit, and could be considered a bit boring.\n\nThe Toyota on the other hand is far from boring, in fact it's a bit of a throwback. Sporting bonnet vents, flared arches and very aggressive exhaust pipes. It's a little raucous, and wild, and what a hot hatch should all be about. Sensible styling is overrated, and so very nineties.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Pros\n\n1. A wild looking child with a definite glint in its eye.\n\n2. This is how hot hatches should look, somewhat fierce.\n\n3. Vents, triple exhausts and big spoiler. You only live once.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. So boring to look at, the Golf R can be mistaken for lesser models.\n\n2. Hot hatches are meant to be visually exciting.\n\n3. Way too mainstream for its own good.\n\n8 Toyota's Corolla Is Breaking The Mold\n\nThe most intoxicating compact hot hatch since Ford released the third version of the infamous Focus RS, the Toyota GR Corolla is a car to genuinely get excited about. Giving die hard Toyota brand fans a chance to rejoice, as they come charging back to the performance party.\n\nNot only does the Toyota GR Corolla look awesome, it is all set to tear up the street. Giving it a traditional manual gearbox, sophisticated all-wheel drive system and a high-revving three-cylinder engine grabs not only a gearheads full attention but plenty of headlines as well.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Pros\n\n1. The Toyota GR Corolla isn't afraid to be a little different.\n\n2. Bringing the hardcore hot hatch back to the mainstream marketplace.\n\n3. Explosive three-cylinder engine is in vogue.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. An evolved hot hatch that needs some out of the box rethinking.\n\n2. Four cylinder power plant is a bit last decade.\n\n3. Same old stuff, just with more power and pace.\n\n7 Future Icon Status Is Guaranteed\n\nThere is a strong whiff of brilliance about the Toyota GR Corolla. From the way it chews up a straight with ballistic fervor, to the ease in which it slices up corners. It's like the greatest Toyota's of old were robbed of DNA, and a new breed of hero grown from their legends.\n\nThis raw brilliance shines from every orifice of the Toyota GR Corolla. Whether it is simply standing still in a crowded parking lot, or ripping its way around a circuit. That enchanting feel or glow you get from a truly special car is present, and it will ensure the GR Corolla is iconic.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Pros\n\n1. A very special feeling car with its own unique automotive aura.\n\n2. It sets a new bar for modern sporting hatchbacks.\n\n3. Talented Toyota DNA harvested and reborn.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. The VW Golf R needs to try harder at being different.\n\n2. Way too mature compared to rivals.\n\n3. Lots of talent, but just lacking in hair-raising excitement.\n\n6 The Special Edition Feels More Special\n\nAt present, there are two special edition GR Corolla models for a gearhead to salivate over. The Morizo edition does away with the rear seats to shave 30 kg off its curb weight. The engine's torque also gets upped to 295 lb/ft, and overall gearing having been shortened.\n\nThe Toyota GR Corolla Circuit Edition is a base core version with a smattering of performance goodies, plus a carbon fiber roof. Only 1000 official Circuit Edition vehicles were released. Both special editions will no doubt become collectibles and have their own unique appeal.\n\nPricing\n\nMSRP\n\n2023 Toyota GR Corolla Core\n\n$35,900\n\n2023 Toyota GR Corolla Circuit Edition\n\n$43,995\n\n2023 Toyota GR Corolla Morizo\n\n$50,995\n\n5 The GR Corolla Is Better Value\n\nGetting into a basic specification Toyota GR Corolla costs $35,900. Which, in the grand scheme of performance cars, is very little for what is on offer. In comparison, the base price of a Volkswagen Golf R weighs in at a $43,835 which is an enormous difference between them.\n\nThe limited supply Toyota GR Corolla Circuit Edition sits at a more comparable price to the VW Golf R, and offers far more exclusivity. Snapping up a base GR Corolla makes far more financial sense, as out in the real world it does everything the Golf R can, for much less.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Pros\n\n1. Cheap, but far from being nasty.\n\n2. A performance bargain that makes its rival seem overpriced.\n\n3. The huge saving can go on some choice performance modifications.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. A lot of money for not a lot of benefits.\n\n2. The prestige of the VW brand and badge comes at a hefty price.\n\n3. Load on the options and it becomes a very expensive hatch back.\n\n4 A GR Corolla Is Rooted To Being A Hot Hatch\n\nAt no point does the Toyota GR Corolla deviate from being anything other than a fantastic hot hatch. From the out there styling treats, to the way it drives. It embraces what it is and runs with the ball. The same though can't really be said about the mature Volkswagen Golf R.\n\nMid-way to becoming an executive car, the Volkswagen Golf R feels like a vehicle that looks down on the GR Corolla. It's beautifully made, and trimmed, but all a bit too grown up. It's completely forgotten that great hot hatches are supposed to be a little rough and ready.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Performance\n\n0-60 MPH\n\n4.9 seconds\n\nTop Speed\n\n143 mph\n\nCurb Weight\n\n1475 kg / 3252 lbs\n\n3 Exclusivity Is King On The Street\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf R is quite a common sight on the streets. Starting with the Golf R32 over twenty-years ago and running through to the newest incarnation, the Golf R badge covers five distinct versions. With each version becoming more popular with buyers than the last.\n\nThe Toyota GR Corolla is the fresh-faced new kid on the block. An all new concept and vehicle that makes the Volkswagen Golf R look common. Spotting one on the street will be epic, and getting hold of one as an owner even better. It's very exclusive, and so very cool.\n\nToyota GR Corolla Pros\n\n1. It's new, very funky and fairly low volume.\n\n2. An attention grabbing machine that will have gearheads pointing in appreciation.\n\n3. No one will be expecting a Corolla to perform as well as it does.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. Older versions are cheap, and a common sight on the roads.\n\n2. The Golf R doesn't have the current cache of the GR Corolla.\n\n3. The R badge has been around for over two decades, so the sparkle has faded.\n\n2 It Has An 'In Vogue' Engine To Brag About\n\nPutting aside the early Golf R32s, the more recent versions of the Volkswagen Golf R make their power from an established four cylinder turbocharged unit. It's a great engine, and highly responsive. But four-cylinder engines could be considered as no longer fashionable.\n\nTo really set yourself apart, you have to be rocking a forced induction three-cylinder turbo these days. And what an engine it is. Debuting in the equally impressive Toyota GR Yaris, the gutsy 1.6-liter unit now makes 300 hp and propels the GR Corolla to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds.\n\nEngine Specs\n\nManufacturer\n\nToyota\n\nProduction Years\n\n2020 - Present\n\nConfiguration\n\nInline 3-Cylinder\n\nDisplacement\n\n1.6-Liters\n\nPower\n\n300 hp\n\nTorque\n\n275 - 295 lb/ft\n\nFuel\n\nGasoline\n\nNoteworthy Applications\n\nToyota GR Yaris\n\n1 The Golf R Is Almost Yesterday's Hero\n\nLet's not get away from the fact that the Volkswagen Golf R is a superb car. Its 2.0-liter turbocharged engine delivers 315 hp and a 0-60 mph sprint time of around 4 seconds. That makes it almost super car fast off the line, and capable of flattening the Toyota GR Corolla.\n\nWhere the Volkswagen Golf R falls down is on its evolution. Yes, it's now faster and more agile than ever before, but the song remains the same. It's a car stuck in the past with yesterday's attitudes towards making power, whereas the Toyota GR Corolla is tomorrow's champion.\n\nGR Corolla Pros\n\n1. New age thinking at a time when the automotive industry is in a state of flux.\n\n2. It's a car that will cater to a wide range of gearheads.\n\n3. Immense value for money and a future classic.\n\nVolkswagen Golf R Cons\n\n1. The engine game has moved on considerably.\n\n2. Very fast, but not particularly involving to drive at nine tenths.\n\n3. A lot of money for what is just a very flash Golf.",

He met and interacted with youngsters inside the metro.\n\n\"Looking forward to joining the University of Delhi's centenary celebrations at 11 AM tomorrow, 30th June. As a premier centre of learning, DU has been nurturing talent and fostering intellectual growth for a century. Congratulations to the DU fraternity on this milestone,\" PM Modi tweeted.\n\nDU's valedictory ceremony will be held in the multipurpose hall of the varsity's sports complex. The University of Delhi was established on May 1, 1992. On completion of its 100th year of existence, the varsity observed a grand centenary celebration at its campus on May 1, 2022. Dignitaries including Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu, Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, and Delhi University's Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Singh, among others, participated to grace the university's centennial celebration event.\n\nThe University of Delhi, informally known as Delhi University (DU), was founded in 1922 by an Act of the Central Legislative Assembly and is recognized as an Institute of Eminence (IoE) by the University Grants Commission (UGC).\n\nIt started with only three colleges, two faculties, and 750 students, and since then it has become India's largest institution of higher learning and among the largest in the world. Today, the university has 16 faculties and 86 departments distributed across its north and south campuses. It has 77 constituent colleges and five other institutes. Today, more than 6 lakh students are studying in different colleges affiliated with Delhi University. The Vice President of India serves as the university chancellor.",

                "title": "NFL suspends 3 players indefinitely for violating the gambling policy and a fourth gets 6 games",
                "body": "FILE - Detroit Lions defensive lineman Demetrius Taylor works out during an NFL football practice in Allen Park, Mich., Saturday, May 14, 2022. The NFL suspended three players indefinitely Thursday, June 29, 2023, for violating the league's gambling policy and a fourth was sidelined for six games. Isaiah Rodgers and Rashod Berry of the Indianapolis Colts along with free agent Demetrius Taylor received indefinite suspensions through at least this season for betting on NFL games in 2022.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Cornerback Isaiah Rodgers Sr. lost the biggest bet of his life Thursday.\n\nHe was waived by the Indianapolis Colts shortly after the NFL suspended Rodgers and two other players indefinitely for gambling on NFL games last season.\n\nThe Colts also cut backup defensive end Rashod Berry after Berry and free agent defensive tackle Demetrius Taylor received the same punishment for the same infraction. None of the three can seek reinstatement until after next season.\n\nTennessee Titans right tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere received a six-game suspension for betting on non-NFL sports at the team's facility, though he can participate in all of the team's offseason and preseason activities including preseason games.\n\nFor the Colts, the decision came swiftly and decisively -- even for a potential starter like Rodgers.\n\n\"We have made the following roster moves as a consequence of the determination that these players violated the league's gambling policy,\" Colts general manager Chris Ballard said in a statement. \"The integrity of the game is of the utmost importance. As an organization we will continue to educate our players, coaches, and staff on the policies in place and the significant consequences that may occur with violations.\"\n\nThose rules bar players, coaches, team officials and all league personnel from betting on NFL games, placing bets at team facilities or team hotels or having someone else place a bet for them.\n\nNFL executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy Jeff Miller said last week only players are permitted to bet on non-NFL games following consultation with the NFL Players Association.\n\nStill gambling policy violations are becoming increasingly common with the expansion of states legalizing sports wagering and other forms of betting and the ease with which bets can be placed on mobile devices.\n\nAnd it seems remarkably prevalent in a league that imposed no gambling suspensions between those involving Paul Hornung and Alex Karras in 1963 until Art Schlichter in 1983.\n\nAt least 10 players have been suspended in the past year, beginning with the 2022 season-long suspension of former Atlanta Falcons receiver Calvin Ridley. He was reinstated in March and now plays for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nFive players were suspended for gambling infractions in April, four from Detroit.\n\nThe Lions have since released receivers Quintez Cephus and Stanley Berryhill and safety C.J. Moore after Cephus and Moore received indefinite suspensions. Lions general manager Brad Holmes said at the time Cephus and Moore \"exhibited decision-making that is not consistent with our organizational values and violates league rules.\"\n\nBerryhill and receiver Jameson Williams were given six-game suspensions. Taylor also played for the Lions last season and was released in May.\n\nThe other player, Washington Commanders defensive end Shaka Toney, also received an indefinite suspension. Toney, a seventh-round pick in 2021; Williams, the No. 12 overall draft pick in 2022; and Petit-Frere still have jobs.\n\nWhile the league already has reinforced its gambling policy to the more than 17,000 NFL employees, it's also making the rounds for annual presentations at team facilities.\n\n\"The league just comes in, they give their piece on it with what they talk about and how they handle it and what the players need to know and going forward in that matter,\" new Colts coach Shane Steichen said after the investigation into Rodgers' actions went public earlier this month.\n\nIt's not just that there's more gambling.\n\nA website that covers sports wagering, sportshandle.com, reported an unidentified Colts player placed \"hundreds\" of bets, some on Colts games. Rodgers later responded to the report with a Twitter post in which he acknowledged making \"mistakes\" while hoping to \"repair\" the damage.\n\nRodgers, a fourth-year player from UMass, won't get that chance in Indy. But Tennessee is taking a different approach with its starting right tackle.\n\n\"We believe in Nick and know that he has deep respect for the integrity of the game and our organization,\" the Titans said in a statement. \"We will continue to emphasize to our players the importance of understanding and adhering to league rules and policies.\"\n\nLosing key players to suspensions is taking a toll.\n\nNew Titans general manager Ran Carthon made Petit-Frere the centerpiece of a revamped offensive line. He's the only returning starter expected to play the same spot as last season and can't return until after Tennessee's bye week, Oct. 29 against Atlanta.\n\nIn a statement he posted on social media, Petit-Frere apologized to the Titans and his family while making clear his bets were legal under Tennessee law.\n\n\"It is only being sanctioned because it occurred at the Titans facility ...,\" Petit-Frere said in the statement. \"I have always strived in every stage of my life to follow the rules. Even after attending a league presentation, I was unaware about the specifics around placing bets from a team facility.\"\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason and current broadcaster believes not knowing the rules is simply an excuse. He also called on the NFL to provide support for those in the league who have gambling addictions.\n\n\"I know for a fact that the Jets and Giants, in OTAs and minicamps, went over these policies with their teams incessantly so they know what they can and cannot do,\" said Esiason, the NFL's 1988 MVP. \"So, any player that comes out and says, 'Well, they didn't tell me,' that's a pile of crap. It's on the player to be the professional that you're supposed to be and earn the money that you're earning and play in a league that you're privileged to play in and protect that league's integrity by not betting on the league.\"\n\nBerry and Petit-Frere were teammates at Ohio State before Berry was signed by New England as an undrafted rookie in 2020. Berry spent most of last season on the Jags practice squad before joining Indy's active roster Jan. 4.\n\nThe bigger blow in Indy is losing Rodgers in a secondary already under reconstruction. He was expected to provide a veteran's voice in a young position room that includes four draft picks. Now, he's out of a job as the Colts move forward.\n\n\"I think any time something like this comes up, you've got to push it aside and move on,\" Steichen said. \"But the players have been good so far in the building.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Teresa M. Walker in Nashville, Tennessee and Rob Maaddi and AP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Boston also contributed to this report.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

It simply means that the company's cars can legally fly over the United States.\n\nIt is worth noting that this is the first time that a vehicle of this kind (a flying car) has been certified in America.\n\nAs per the official statement from Alef Aeronautics, the FAA is actively working on its policies for electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, as well as the regulations governing interactions between eVTOLs and ground infrastructure.\n\n\"Alef's Special Airworthiness Certificate, therefore, limits the locations and purpose for which Alef is permitted to fly,\" the company added in the statement.\n\nIt is a versatile vehicle that can be driven on the road and also used to fly over traffic. The company claims that the vehicle has a driving range of 200 miles (322 km) and a flying range of 110 miles (177 km).\n\nSpeaking of Alef Aeronautics, the company is based in California's San Mateo and specialises in automotive and aviation. Their flying car is fully electric and has the capacity to carry one or two occupants. According to Fox News, the current cost of this traffic-flying car is approximately $300,000.\n\nIn October 2022, Alef Aeronautics revealed a sports car model along with two functional technology demonstrator cars. In January of this year, the company announced that over 440 of its vehicles had been pre-ordered by both individual and corporate customers.\n\nAccording to reports cited by NDTV, the company is planning to deliver these flying cars to customers by the end of 2025.\n\n\"Alef is aiming to deliver the first real flying car in history, and to receive so many early pre-orders is an incredible validation of the market potential we're looking to satisfy,\" Alef's CEO Jim Dukhovny stated in a statement earlier this year.\n\nAccording to its website, the flying car is being developed for driving on a \"regular urban or rural road.\" It can be parked in a regular parking space and inside a regular-sized garage.\n\nThe official website of the company states that the flying car is being developed with the needs of the people in mind. It is designed to be driven on both regular urban and rural roads. Furthermore, the car is designed to be parked in a regular-sized garage and can fit in a standard parking space.",

                "body": "Abasiekeme Morrison and his parents, Patrina Thomas-Morrison and Amazu Morrison holding his baby brother, at a 2022 prize giving ceremony at school.\n\nABASIEKEME MORRISON'S Nigerian first name, meaning 'God is able', epitomises the youngster's ongoing academic journey.\n\nThe 10-year-old, a student at Hagley Park Preparatory School in St Andrew, is now breathing a sigh of relief following the recent announcement of the results of the Primary Exit Profile (PEP) examinations.\n\nHe has demonstrated his ability to perform academically at the highest levels and has been named the top performer for PEP and general academics at his school.\n\nAs indicated on his student placement report, he also performed better than 97 per cent of all test takers on the Ability Test. His overall performance has resulted in him passing for his second-choice school, Ardenne High.\n\nHe will also serve as valedictorian at his school's graduation ceremony to be held on July 2 at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston.\n\nMorrison participates in a variety of extracurricular activities like violin and piano lessons, studies three languages - Mandarin, French, and Spanish, plays sports like tae kwon do, chess, tennis, and swimming, and is a member of the school's quiz team.\n\nAs a well-rounded student, Morrison, who is affectionately called 'Abasi', said it was crucial for him to understand the significance of finding a schoolwork-life balance.\n\nBy creating a timetable, he has been able to study efficiently while also making adequate time for recreational activities, he said.\n\nAbasi informed The Gleaner that his first choice was to attend Campion College, and that he thought he could've done better on his examinations to achieve this. Nonetheless, he stated that he was very proud of his performance and was now looking forward to new beginnings at Ardenne High.\n\nHis father, Amazu Morrison, stated that although he would have preferred his son to be awarded his first-choice school, he was confident that where he was placed is where he was destined to be.\n\n\"My whole belief is that God knows what's best and he is getting to go to this school that is best for him,\" the elder Morrison said.\n\nIn an interview with The Gleaner, Dr Paulene Gayle Betten, principal of Hagley Park Prep, described Abasi as an \"exceptional student\", who was very \"gifted and intelligent.\"\n\nShe said that he has always been attentive in class and had an inquiring mind, a trait which she hopes he will carry into high school.\n\nYoung Abasi aspires to become a marine biologist and his favourite subjects are mathematics and science. Through his own experiences, he has learnt how crucial it is to recognise the type of studying methods that best suited him.\n\n\"How I got to this point wasn't by studying, studying, as in reading through a textbook and going through the entire thing. For many people, this [can be] boring and most of the time you have to start over and over again because you don't remember what you just read,\" he explained.\n\n\"So, what I would advise [students] to do, would be to ... turn [studying] into an educational game,\" Abasi offered.\n\nThe elder Morrison detailed how his son has always been driven in his academic pursuits and would organise his own study groups with his peers, search for his own material to review outside of class notes and textbooks, and was not reliant on his parents for help.\n\nSharing this view his mother, Patrina Thomas-Morrison, informed The Gleaner that her son has always been a very focused child when on his own terms.\n\n\"I say [this] because he was relatively very relaxed during the preparation process. He doesn't like to feel flustered, he doesn't like to feel overwhelmed, [and so] he goes at his own pace,\" she said.\n\nShe then encouraged parents to adopt an approach of ensuring that their child is not pushed into studying for prolonged periods as this can cause burnout and result in the kids being less likely to retain the material.\n\n\"They need to recognise the signs of that. When they become very lethargic, very uninterested in the work or they're falling asleep a lot, low energy, those kinds of signs kind of give you some indication that they're just really spent,\" she added, stating that every child is different and what may result in one child's success might not be the case for another.\n\nAlong with studying at home, Abasi, she said, would also spend many evenings in extra lessons and most of his Sundays over several months at school with his fellow schoolmates participating in PEP marathons hosted by their teachers, Mrs Russell and Mrs Balfour, to whom the family is extremely grateful.\n\nShe explained that the family's reaction to his achievements has been joyous as all his relatives are proud and happy for his successes.\n\n\"Everybody is of the view that they know he could do it and one of the things that most persons, including the teachers and the principal at his school, would say, is that he is younger than all of the students in his class ... so it's an accomplishment for him at his young age,\" she noted.\n\nThomas-Morrison and her husband said that they were looking forward to offering the necessary support needed for when he transitions to grade seven and how high school would foster his overall growth and development.\n\n\"He's still 10, he's going to be 11 years old in the next two weeks, so he's still not at the level of focus that would be ideal. So as he grows and becomes more focused I look forward to see what he'll become,\" the elder Morrison said, adding that he knows that his son holds great potential and that he is looking forward to seeing it realised in his life.",

                "title": " \"Gutted as well as happier\" - Ben Duckett on missing out on century in 2nd Ashes Test against Australia",
                "body": "England batter Ben Duckett was gutted, but at the same time seemed content, after missing out on a century against Australia in the first innings of the second Ashes Test at Lord's on Thursday, June 29. The England opener led his team's fightback with 98 runs from 134 balls after Australia posted 416 in the first inning.\n\nDuckett played second fiddle to Zak Crawley in their 91-run opening stand. Although Crawley missed his half-century by just two runs, Duckett reached his before the tea break. He hit nine boundaries before an attempted pull shot off a Josh Hazlewood short-ball led to his dismissal when he was just two runs away from his third Test century.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports about his brilliant innings after the gameplay of the second day, Ben Duckett said:\n\n\"I am gutted obviously. I had to take out the start that I had. Gutted as well as happier. I felt like it was probably my best knock so far. Yeah it's a shame, I was back in the way I was playing. That one rushed me quicker and unfortunately went straight to Warner.\"\n\nDuckett didn't have a great time with the bat in the Ashes opener in Edgbaston as he returned with scores of 12 and 19 in the two innings. The Northamptonshire batter mentioned that a proactive approach with the bat helped him make progress at Lord's. He said:\n\n\"Yeah I would say so (batting with a proactive approach). Done a lot of work this week. I felt like last game I missed out my strength on a good pitch there. Today, I was really happy with the kind of slashes over gully.\"\n\nBen Duckett hit his first boundary of the innings off Mitchell Starc. The left-hander got an outside edge that went down to the third-man region. He waited for another 23 balls to score his next boundary. There was a period when the Australian pacers tested the English batters with a barrage of short balls. Duckett was a bit more defensive in that period.\n\nExplaining his approach against different Australian bowlers, Ben Duckett said:\n\n\"We just go and react to the situation. That was my slowest knock, probably in English (conditions). It was just that I could trust my defense and hit the bad balls to the boundary. Even today, I felt Lyon was bowling pretty well to me, where I could back my defense. We were scoring pretty well at the other end.\"\n\nEngland ended Day 2 at 278 for four, 138 runs behind Australia's first-innings total. Harry Brook (45) and Ben Stokes (17) will resume the innings for the hosts on the third day.",

                "body": "Lewis Hamilton says a ban on developing next year's car until a fixed date could held stop Red Bull Racing from consolidating its hefty pace advantage in future season.\n\nRed Bull Racing's RB19 is comfortably the fastest car on the grid this year and the easy championship favourite, and team principal Christian Horner has suggested Milton Keynes has already switched focus to its 2024 challenger.\n\nThe redirection of development resources is encouraged in part by the team's punishment for breaking the 2021 cost cap, for which it was slapped with a 10 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time.\n\nWatch the Formula 1 Austrian Grand Prix 2023 live and ad-break free in racing on Kayo Sports on Sunday, 2 July, at 11:00pm AEST. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\nBut the decision was made easier by the size of Red Bull Racing's advantage, which almost guarantees the team the title regardless of whether it continues to bring upgrades this season.\n\nIt's a foreboding scenario for its would-be challengers and fans of the sport, who are facing another stretch of one-team domination fresh from eight successive years of Mercedes constructors championships.\n\nHamilton was the chief beneficiary of the German marque's glittering reign, but the Briton said the sport must find a way to break the cycle of supremacy and open up the competition for regular victories.\n\n\"In my 17 years of being here, even before I got here, you would see periods of dominance, and it continues to happen,\" he said, per Autosport.\n\n\"I was very fortunate to have one of those periods, and Max is having one now.\n\n\"With the way it's going, it will continue to happen over and over again, and I don't think we need that in the sport.\"\n\nHamilton suggested the way to break the cycle was to ban teams from getting a head start on their cars for the following year, thereby preventing them from banking a big advantage for use in subsequent campaigns.\n\n\"When you are so far ahead, 100 points ahead, you don't really need to do a lot of development on your car, so you can start earlier on your next car,\" he said.\n\n\"And with the budget cap, that means spending that year's money on next year's car.\n\n\"But if everyone had a time, for example, if everyone knew when we can really start, whatever date it is -- October is way too late probably, but 1 August, something like that -- then no-one has a head start, and then it's a real race in that short space of time for the future car.\n\n\"I don't know, maybe that would help everyone be closer the following year.\"\n\nFormula 1 has instituted a cost cap to equalise the field. Teams also have their wind tunnel time restricted in reverse order of their position in the constructors championship, giving the lower-ranked squads more development resource to close the gap.\n\nBut Hamilton said there was more the sport could do to rein in the biggest teams.\n\n\"I might be wrong, but something's got to change,\" he said. \"When we were winning world championships we could start earlier than everybody else.\n\n\"It would be cool to see in the next period if we don't have huge bands of time when one team is ahead, because we want to see better racing.\"\n\nVerstappen was asked whether he agreed with the concept of a restricted development window, but the Dutchman was unmoved.\n\n\"Life is unfair as well, it's not only in Formula 1,\" said the title leader. \"A lot of things are unfair, so we just have to deal with it.\"",

These are generally smaller, ground effect type things,\" Beckmeyer said.\n\nShawn Green and his family bought a number of fireworks for their Independence Day celebrations.\n\nIn Pacifica, all of the fireworks stands are run by local nonprofits who use the money raised for their causes.\n\nAll the more reason, Green says, to shop in town.\n\n\"We're fortunate here that Pacifica has a number of different firework stands that support different places within Pacifica,\" Green said.\n\nMORE: You can do snow, summer sports in Lake Tahoe this 4th of July holiday weekend\n\nBut fireworks aren't the only thing expected to bring people to the coast this weekend.\n\nAs temperatures heat up to as high as the triple digits in some parts of the Bay Area, many people are expected to head to the beach here in Pacifica to stay cool.\n\nJayson Summers drove in from Richmond to have a beach day on Thursday.\n\nHe says as the heat turns up in the East Bay over the coming days, he thinks more people will likely make the drive over to find some relief.\n\n\"Places like here, downtown San Francisco, all over those places, everyone goes to the beach as soon as it gets like over 75 degrees,\" Summers said.",

                "body": "ONE Championship CEO Chatri Sityodtong is preparing to deliver a massive can't-miss event in Qatar.\n\nEarlier this month, the promotion signed a memorandum of understanding with Media City Qatar as ONE continues its expansion into the Middle East. The memorandum, or MOU, is an extension of a strategic partnership both parties entered into last year. Speaking with the South China Morning Post, ONE CEO Chatri Sityodtong revealed plans to book a mega-sized card for their highly anticipated debut which could come as earlier as this year.\n\n\"We're going to have a mega card. It's going to blow out, you know, the lights in the region but around the world as well,\" Sityodtong said. \"Right now, it's going to be primetime in the Middle East, which is primetime in Europe as well.\"\n\nONE Championship is certainly no stranger to booking big events in big locations. On May 5, the promotion made its long-awaited U.S. debut with ONE Fight Night 10 on Prime Video. The event featured some of the biggest names in all of combat sports, including Rodtang Jitmuangnon, Stamp Fairtex, Demetrious Johnson, and the returning 'Super' Sage Northcutt.\n\nSince then, the promotion has been delivering star-studded events inside the legendary Lumpinee Boxing Stadium, including a fantastic ONE Friday Fights 22 card that saw a new undisputed heavyweight world champion crowned. Undefeated Russian juggernaut Anatoly Malykhin scored a vicious second-round TKO over Arjan Bhullar, turning his interim title into unified gold.\n\nThe event also featured the epic return of Superlek Kiatmoo9 to the art of eight limbs. 'The Kicking Machine' scored a first-round knockout against ONE Championship newcomer Nabil Anane, once against establishing himself as one of the greatest strikers in the sport today.\n\nWith ONE's penchant for booking stellar events, which fights would you like to see when the promotion heads to Qatar for the very first time?\n\nIf you missed any of the action, the ONE Friday Fights 22 replay can be watched anytime via ONE Championship's YouTube channel.",

                "body": "Αίσιο τέλος είχε η περιπέτεια που έζησε νεαρή Πολωνή την Πέμπτη (29/6) καθώς η προσπάθειά της να διασχίσει το διάσημο φαράγγι της Καλυψούς στην περιοχή του Κόκκινου Νερού, έθεσε σε κίνδυνο τη ζωή της.\n\nΗ νεαρή ξεκίνησε πεζοπορία από το μεσημέρι, σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες του onlarissa.gr χρησιμοποιώντας εφαρμογή πλοήγησης, χρησιμοποίησε στίγμα διαδρομής για είσοδο στο φαράγγι από ένα εξαιρετικά δύσβατο σημείο που χρησιμοποιείται μόνον από επαγγελματίες για κατάβαση.\n\nΑποτέλεσμα ήταν να εγκλωβιστεί σε βράχο, ελάχιστα δίπλα σε γκρεμό βάθους περίπου 100 μέτρων και μάλιστα σε αντίξοες καιρικές συνθήκες καθώς άρχισε να βρέχει.\n\nΗ γυναίκα έκανε χρήση του διεθνή αριθμού έκτακτης ανάγκης 112 και ειδοποίησε τις αρχές. Σωτήρια για τη διάσωσή της ήταν η ψυχραιμία της, όπως εξήγησε μιλώντας στο onlarissa.gr ο αντιδήμαρχος Αγιάς και επιχειρηματίας με τεράστια εμπειρία στο χώρο των action sports κ. Νίκος Ντάγκας ο οποίος είπε χαρακτηριστικά ότι \"διατήρησε τόσο την ψυχραιμία της, όσο και την ψυχολογία της σε τέτοια επίπεδα που της επέτρεψαν να βοηθήσει τον εαυτό της\".\n\nΕξίσου σημαντική ήταν κατά τον κ. Ντάγκα η άμεση κινητοποίηση της 8ης ΕΜΑΚ αλλά και η καθοδήγηση που έδωσε στην Πολωνή μέχρι την προσέγγισή της από τα σωστικά συνεργία.\n\nΚαθοριστικό ρόλο όμως συνετέλεσαν και δύο αγρότες από την περιοχή της Μελιβοίας οι οποίοι διατηρούν κτήματα στην παρακείμενη περιοχή και γνωρίζουν άριστα τα μονοπάτια και την προσβασιμότητα στο φαράγγι.\n\nΤελικά οι αγρότες καθώς και οι διασώστες της ΕΜΑΚ έφθασαν στο σημείο όπου είχε εγκλωβιστεί η νεαρή και την απομάκρυναν με ασφάλεια.",

                "title": "Tennis und IT: Wie Wimbledon Technologie und Tradition vereint",
                "body": "Bill Jinks und Chris Clements sorgen dafür, dass auf dem heiligen Rasen von Wimbledon IT-seitig alle Register gezogen werden. Unsere spanische Kollegin hatte Gelegenheit zu einem Gespräch.\n\nSüdwestlich von London bereitet sich die Stadt Wimbledon auf die Neuauflage des ältesten Grand-Slam-Turniers vor. Beim wichtigsten Tennis-Event der Welt (3. bis 16. Juli) sollen sich Tradition und Moderne die Waage halten, eine Herausforderung für die Verantwortlichen Bill Jinks, Technologiedirektor des All England Lawn Tennis Club, und Chris Clements, Leiter digitale Produkte.\n\nTennis ist für London das, was Mode für Paris ist. Was bedeutet es, in diesem Jahr die 136. Auflage zu feiern?\n\nBill Jinks: Das Wimbledon-Erbe zu bewahren, ist für uns besonders wichtig, es zählt zu unseren Grundwerten. Wir möchten, dass jeder, der mit dem Turnier zu tun hat, ein unvergessliches Erlebnis genießen kann. Als Technologieteam kümmern wir uns um technische Innovationen, ohne dabei den Charme der Veranstaltung zu riskieren.\n\nWarum ist das so wichtig?\n\nBill Jinks: Wir müssen sicherstellen, dass Wimbledon das zentrale Highlight im Tenniskalender bleibt. Es ist nicht nur ein sportliches, sondern auch ein kulturelles Ereignis. Wir haben hier ein Publikum, das weit über den eingefleischten Tennisfan hinausgeht.\n\nInwiefern hat Technologie im Laufe der Jahre Einzug in Wimbledon gehalten?\n\nChris Clements: Die Art und Weise, wie wir traditionelle Elemente mit Technologie verbinden, ist schon einzigartig. Wir wollen sicherstellen, dass die Tradition in allem, was wir tun, präsent ist. Das gilt auch für die technischen Innovationen, an denen wir gerade arbeiten.\n\nVerfolgt der All England Lawn Tennis Club eine bestimmte Strategie in seiner digitalen Transformation?\n\nChris Clements: Wir müssen tolle Erlebnisse schaffen - für unsere Gäste vor Ort, genauso wie für diejenigen, die unser Turnier über die Medien verfolgen. Dabei geht es uns darum, unser globales Publikum ständig zu vergrößern. Wir sehen uns auch als Botschafter für das Tennis generell. Diese Sportart soll florieren und einen positiven Einfluss haben. Technologie hilft uns beim Erreichen dieser Ziele, sie steht im Mittelpunkt unserer Strategie.\n\nBill Jinks: Wir wollen die Magie von Wimbledon allen zugänglich machen - über unsere Website und unsere mobilen Apps, über die wir außergewöhnliche Benutzererlebnisse bieten, aber auch mit anderen digitalen Möglichkeiten, die über unsere Medienplattformen hinausgehen. Und obwohl wir hier noch nicht alles verraten können, gibt es doch Beispiele, die wir bereits umgesetzt haben. So haben wir auf der Gaming-Plattform Roblox ein virtuelles Erlebnis namens WimbleWorld hinzugefügt, das ein jüngeres Publikum sehr erfolgreich angesprochen hat.\n\nChris Clements: Eine neue Funktion, auf die wir uns besonders freuen, ist der KI-Kommentar. Dabei werden den Highlight-Videos auf Wimbledon.com KI-generierte Texte hinzufügt, gesprochen oder wahlweise auch als Untertitel. Ein zweites Highlight, ebenfalls auf Basis von KI-Technik, ist die Analyse der kommenden Spielpaarungen. Dabei wird der potenzielle Weg eines jeden Spielers und jeder Spielerin ins Finale bewertet.\n\nFür welche Technologien geben Sie in diesem Jahr am meisten Geld aus?\n\nBill Jinks: Wir arbeiten seit 34 Jahren mit IBM in einem kontinuierlichen Innovationsprozess zusammen. Dabei entwickeln wir gemeinsam Ideen und stoßen Projekte an, die uns helfen, unsere Ambitionen umzusetzen und unsere Ziele zu erreichen. Normalerweise beginnen wir mit einer langen Liste von Ideen und filtern diejenigen heraus, die es wert sind, ausprobiert zu werden. Wenn wir richtig liegen, sind das dann die Plattformen und Technologien, die wir im nächsten Jahr implementieren werden.\n\nHat sich die Technologie im Laufe der Zeit auch auf die Spieler ausgewirkt?\n\nBill Jinks: Ja. Heute gibt es in der Welt des Sports Unmengen an Daten. Wie ist das Spiel abgelaufen? Wohin wurde der Ball häufig geschlagen? Wie gelang es, zu punkten? IBM analysiert solche Daten, auch um einen Mehrwert für die Spielerinnen und Spieler selbst zu schaffen. Wir stellen den Tennisstars Analysetools zur Verfügung, mit denen sie ihre Spiele nacherleben und im Detail analysieren können. Sie bekommen Datenangebote, die weit über das hinausgehen, was auf digitalen Kanälen oder im Fernsehen zu sehen ist.\n\nBeispielsweise bieten wir ihnen in diesem Jahr eine neue Art von Statistik an, die allein auf dem Flugverlauf des Balls basieren. Benutzt ein Spieler die offizielle App, werden ihm alle für ihn relevanten Dienste angezeigt. Das ist ein Trend, den wir in Zukunft verstärken werden.\n\nInwieweit profitiert das weltgrößte Tennisturnier konkret von der Digitalisierung?\n\nChris Clements: In den letzten vier oder fünf Jahren hatten wir mehr als 21 Millionen Fans, die unsere digitalen Plattformen nutzten. Das ist eine fantastische Zahl, die wir weiter ausbauen wollen. Unsere digitalen Produkte sind speziell auf Tennis und Wimbledon ausgerichtet. Wir bieten den Fans viel mehr, als sie anderswo finden. Letztlich geht es darum, dass sie mehr aus ihrem Zuschauererlebnis herausholen, den Sport besser verstehen und begreifen, warum Wimbledon etwas Besonderes ist. Ich denke, dass wir das mit vielen unserer Initiativen erreicht haben.\n\nWas sind die größten Herausforderungen als Technologie-Manager von Wimbledon?\n\nBill Jinks: Eine der größten Herausforderungen besteht darin sicherzustellen, dass wir pünktlich startbereit sind. Da es schon in wenigen Tagen losgeht, müssen wir auf die Tube drücken. Generell ist die Integration neuer Technologien mit vorhandenen Systemen und Prozessen nie trivial. Das ganze Jahr über sind wir ein kleines Unternehmen, doch einmal im Jahr richten sich international alle Scheinwerfer auf uns. Da muss alles funktionieren. Wir wollen bereit sein, ein unvergessliches Erlebnis zu bieten, wenn sich am nächsten Montag die Pforten öffnen.\n\nUnsere Fans können erwarten, dass sie viel mehr von Wimbledon zu sehen bekommen als bisher. Sie werden dank neuer Daten neue Perspektiven erleben. Ich hoffe, dass sie das Wimbledon, das sie kennen und lieben, in einer durch die Technologie verbesserten Form genießen können. (hv)",

                "body": "Here are my top five video games of all time: Madden NFL, Call of Duty, Halo, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and MLB: The Show. Curious what other people have in their top five. Email me your lists here. -- Kevin Hitt\n\nBy most accounts, the IOC made a successful debut of Olympic Esports Week in Singapore last week. It gives the esports industry and its fans renewed hope that the Olympic movement will get behind penalizing competitive gaming and a federation to govern international esports. After all, the event comes just three years after the IOC said it would not recognize any group or organization as a governing body for esports.\n\nIn collaboration with Singapore's Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Sports Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council, the IOC hosted more than 100 players in competitive events such as virtual table tennis and virtual cycling, as well as exhibitions for Rocket League and Street Fighter VI. The exhibition strategy has long been used by the IOC and is used for sports such as baseball, softball or various action sports events such as snowboarding, surfing and skateboarding.\n\nThe common denominator between those action sports and esports? A much younger crowd, something the Olympics lacked.\n\nThe event was streamed on Olympics.com and the audience was miniscule, especially compared to global esports streaming (a peak viewership of just over 23,000 watched the Rocket League exhibition finale).\n\nBut that was not the purpose of this IOC foray. It planted a flag for the esports movement. The event in Singapore, hosted at the Suntec Center, was a great production, similar to the biggest esports events. And now the official IOC website even has an esports tab.\n\nAn encouraging litmus test\n\nSome industry leaders believe that Olympic Esports Week is just the first attempt to further legitimize esports: \"We were incredibly excited to be part of the first steps towards establishing esports as an Olympic sport,\" said Gen.G Esports CEO Arnold Hur to SBJ. \"While this was only an exhibition event, we know from experience with other Olympic-sponsored sports, such as the Asian Games in which we participated, that this is an important first step. ... We hope to be able to come back in the future.\"\n\nThe challenge for the IOC has always been to select games that represent its strong stance against animated violence (shooters, fighting games, etc.). The IOC understandably doesn't want to promote anything that contains guns or violence and requires those selections to at least include a component that promotes a real sport that can be supported by an international sports federation. This explains why games like Tic-Tac Bow (chosen by World Archery) and Virtual Taekwondo (chosen by World Taekwondo) were selected. -- Kevin Hitt\n\nLast month, during the Paris Major, third-party tournament organizer Blast launched the Blast.tv platform - a move the company hopes can improve the viewing experience and lead to increased event revenue. Throughout the Major, Blast.tv accounted for a modest 5%-10% of streaming numbers; however, the viewers they did capture seem to represent a more engaged audience. And Blast is good at that.\n\n\"For the first time we had done something of that scale, we were thrilled to see a very engaged, but minority, [audience]which peaked at just over 10% of total viewers on Friday (May 19) of the Major. Of the four teams that played in their quarterfinals that day, three were decided underdogs -- what Chief Growth Officer Tom Greene tells SBJ is an indication that the platform resonates with diehard fans who are there to watch every game, not just the big-ticket teams.\n\nAccording to Greene, the platform is truly tailored and could add more content offerings in the future. To drive further growth for this particular event, Blast retained the naming rights to the Major and added experience-enhancing features such as:\n\nAccording to Greene, Blast has gained interest from other publishers for the platform since the major. But important challenges remain.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the future is to make Blast.tv an always-on platform. Currently, with the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player breakthrough in full swing, there is no action to broadcast. In today's \"attention economy,\" Blast.tv's biggest hurdle has been forgotten by the fickle esports fan, who most likely navigates to Twitch to watch matches. While Blast is fine with people watching on Twitch, it acknowledges that it will need to add more incentives to make Blast.tv work. \"We want people to view our content on many platforms,\" Greene tells SBJ. \"For us right now, it's about offering a menu of options.\"\n\nAnother challenge facing Blast is how to effectively monetize the platform. There are no plans to pay for Blast.tv content. Greene sees the wind shifting to pay-per-view models as a possibility deep in the future, but that's not an immediate solution to the financial problems tournament organizers face. -- Hunter Cooke",

                "body": "BAHRAIN defeated Greece 38-29 at the Rentis Sports Hall in Athens last night in their final placement fixture of the 24th International Handball Federation (IHF) Men's Junior World Championship to finish the 32-team tournament in 13th position - their best-ever showing in the championship, improving upon the team's 17th place finishes in 1995 and 2019.\n\nHaving taken an 18-13 lead at half-time, the Bahrainis led by nine goals after 15 minutes of the 30-minute second period and were 32-22 ahead when the game entered its last ten minutes.\n\nBut, try as they might, Greece - who are co-hosting the tournament with Germany - just could not close the gap and Bahrain still led by a comfortable 10 goals, at 34-24, with five minutes left till the final buzzer.\n\nPantelis-Leonidas Alexandridis then scored a goal for the hosts to reduce the deficit to nine but less than 30 seconds later, Komail Ali pushed it back up to 10 with a swift riposte that left the scoreboard reading 35-25.\n\nSoon, after Alexandros Koukoulas scored another goal to make it 35-26, Ali delivered another quick rejoinder to increase Bahrain's lead to ten goals again, at 36-26.\n\nWith slightly more than two minutes left, Greece knew they were fighting a losing battle but they kept plugging away and soon Nikolaos Dikaioulias succeeded in getting one past Bahrain goalkeeper Hesham Isa but, this time, it was Mohamed Rabia who provided Bahrain's reply within half a minute.\n\nGreece were still behind, 37-27, with just slightly more than a minute left and Dikaioulias brought the deficit down to nine again only to see Ali score another quick goal to ensure Bahrain were ten ahead again at 38-28.\n\nThe hosts then simply went through the motions as the clock ticked down to full-time with Nikolaos Tzortzinis scoring one final goal just before the buzzer sounded, sending the Bahrain players into a celebratory group hug.\n\n\"This is an amazing victory,\" Bahrain head coach Essam Abdulla told the GDN by phone from Athens. \"The boys played exceptionally well and have created history by not only making it into the main round of this competition for the very first time, but by also finishing in 13th place.\n\n\"This is a huge achievement for us because this means that we rank 13th amongst the best teams in the world. On the previous two occasions that Bahrain qualified for this tournament, we finished in 17th position in both 1995 and 2019.\n\n\"Our boys have played with dedication and purpose and given a tough time to every team they have come up against. We have shown that we are a force to be reckoned with and will rise even further in the future.\"\n\nBahrain started off their campaign on a disappointing note, as they went down, 35-17, to three-time champions Sweden in their first preliminary round game before being held to a 29-29 draw by Slovenia, who only just managed to score a match-saving equaliser seconds before the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe kingdom's team then pummelled Greenland, 63-13, creating new tournament records for the highest-ever team total and biggest victory margin in the process, which enabled them to pip Slovenia on goal-difference after finishing level on three points each and go through to the main round, along with Sweden, who topped Group F after winning all three of their preliminary round games.\n\nHowever, a pair of defeats to Hungary (27-21) and three-time champions Denmark (28-22) in the main round meant that Bahrain failed to qualify for the quarter-finals and headed, instead, into the placement matches round, where they lost the first game, 31-27, to Egypt.\n\nBut the team concluded their campaign with a memorable win last night and, as Abdulla spoke to the GDN, he had to shout to make himself heard over the sound of several young men happily singing a victory song in the background.\n\nThe entire team had earlier rushed to congratulate goalkeeper Isa after he was named the player-of-the-match, photo-bombing the moment he posed for the cameras with his award and turning it into an impromptu celebration photo-op for the complete squad.",

                "body": "A popular question I'm asked as someone whose job it is to watch the White Sox every day is whether or not it's difficult to watch a struggling team.\n\nI always answer by saying, \"I get to watch baseball every day. Even my worst days are good.\"\n\nI have a quote from the Emmy Award-winning sports broadcaster, Ernie Johnson, taped to my desk that reads, \"I have a 'get-to' job.\" It helps keep the bad days in perspective. Most people have a job they have to do. I have one I get to do.\n\nThat outlook is rarely as crystal clear as when the White Sox are playing Angels superstar Shohei Ohtani.\n\nIn the three games before Thursday's 9-7 win and series split over the Angels in Anaheim, Ohtani diced up the White Sox both on the mound and at the plate.\n\nIn Monday's 2-1 victory over the White Sox, he homered 448 feet off of Dylan Cease. In the bottom of the ninth, he helped advance the game-winning run by walking and then executing a double steal that allowed Mike Trout to score on a wild pitch.\n\nOn Tuesday, he struck out 10 batters and hit two home runs - the first American League player to do so since Pedro Ramos in 1963. The Angels won that game 4-2 in a rocky showing from Michael Kopech.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White Sox kept Ohtani in the ballpark in an 11-5 victory, but he picked up three hits, including a triple and two runs scored.\n\nThrough eight innings on Thursday, the White Sox looked fit to hold Ohtani to a fairly blank stat line. 0-for-2 with two walks (one of which was intentional) he came to the plate with two outs and took Kendall Graveman deep on a 1-2 slider. The Angels lost by only two runs instead of four. His 14th home run in the month of June broke Babe Ruth's record for most by a pitcher who also started a game that month.\n\nOn Thursday, Ohtani was named an American League All-Star starter for a third consecutive season - a fitting end to a historic, record-breaking series against the White Sox.\n\nAs the White Sox head to Oakland for a three-game set against the A's, I imagine I'll need a few good looks at that quote taped to my desk.\n\nBut when the White Sox play the Angels, the reminder to be grateful is right there in the flesh.",

                "body": "Parce que le Tour de France ne se vit pas que derrière la télévision ou au bord des routes, retrouvez les meilleurs livres du moment pour profiter pleinement des trois semaines de course.\n\nAlberto Contador, El Pistolero, Clément Pernia et Julien Moreau, éditions Talent Sport\n\nPassé par la rédaction des sports au Figaro, Julien Moreau sort en compagnie d'un autre jeune journaliste, Clément Pernia, une nouvelle biographie de référence sur Alberto Contador, vainqueur du Tour de France 2007 et 2009 mais aussi de deux Tours d'Italie (2008 et 2015) et trois Vuelta (2008, 2012, 2014). Contador ou l'itinéraire d'un soliste aérien sur son vélo. Un destin unique aussi. Plongé dans le coma à 24 ans pendant trois semaines, le surdoué de Pinto est autant l'icône adulée en Espagne que l'athlète par qui le scandale est arrivé avec une affaire de dopage égratignant son image. Le titre de sa victoire en 2010 lui a d'ailleurs été retiré. L'enquête regorge de témoignages de suiveurs de la course mais aussi de grandes figures comme Bernard Hinault et Bernard Thévenet ou de l'un des plus grands rivaux de Contador, Andy Schleck.\n\nLes forcés de la route, Étienne Bonamy, éditions en exergue\n\nL'histoire folle du \"Tour de France\" 1942 organisé à l'initiative d'un quotidien collaborationniste en pleine Seconde Guerre Mondiale. Du 28 septembre au 4 octobre, 72 coureurs partent à l'assaut d'une pâle imitation de la Grande Boucle baptisée Circuit de France. Un fiasco sur toute la ligne et une parodie d'épreuve qu'Étienne Bonamy, ancien rédacteur en chef à L'Équipe fait revivre à travers un magnifique roman et des personnages attachants, perdus ou errants dans cette drôle d'aventure. Passionnant.\n\nUne histoire des courses cyclistes, Jean-Noël Blanc, éditions Glénat\n\nGrand amateur de vélo et déjà auteur de plusieurs ouvrages de référence sur le sujet (Le Tour de France n'aura pas lieu, notamment), Jean-Noël Blanc retrace la fabuleuse odyssée de l'histoire des courses cyclistes, des origines en 1867 (avec une course allant de l'avenue d'Antin à Versailles) jusqu'à la Grande Boucle actuelle, événement sportif planétaire. Des pionniers à l'e-pédaleur en passant par les tricheries ou l'ère du cyclisme business et ses dérives, l'auteur raconte son histoire du vélo. On picore chaque chapitre avec curiosité.\n\nCols de légende, Nicolas Geay, éditions Amphora\n\nOn ne résiste pas à l'envie de vous présenter une nouvelle fois ce livre, indispensable à tout bon amateur de vélo et amoureux du Tour de France lorsque les pentes deviennent impitoyables avec les coureurs. Le Galibier, L'Alpe d'Huez, l'Izoard, l'Aubisque, le Tourmalet sont autant de noms qui ont bercé les jeunesses et alimenté les rêves les plus fous au moment de chevaucher sa bicyclette pour jouer les Bahamontes, Pantani ou autre Virenque. Nicolas Geay passe en revue les plus mythiques ascensions de l'histoire de la Grande Boucle. Chaque difficulté est présentée, disséquée et explorée en profondeur avec des entretiens de coureurs. On a apprécié en bonus, le petit \" conseil matos \" et le \" bon plan \" qui aident à préparer sa sortie vers les sommets.\n\nJean-Paul Vespini, 1903, l'épopée du premier Tour de France, éditions Mareuil\n\n120 ans ! Une éternité. Le premier Tour de France s'est élancé depuis Montgeron, en banlieue parisienne, le 1er juillet 1903. Une aventure hors norme pour ces soixante amateurs sortis de leurs ateliers et des usines, prêts à se frotter aux six étapes de 400 km au programme (elles sont trois fois moins longues aujourd'hui) pouvant s'étirer sur 17 heures ! Sur des vélos pesant 16 kilos, sans freins (vous avez bien lu !) et munis de jantes en bois, Maurice Garin a été le premier à graver son nom dans le palmarès du Tour de France. Une aventure mais aussi une immense fête à travers le pays qui allait très vite tomber amoureux de cet événement.\n\nInstantanés du Tour, Jérémy Lempin, auto-édition, à venir\n\nJérémy Lempin est, en juillet 2022, parti en camping-car avec l'idée de plonger au cœur du Tour de l'après-Covid, pour voir si la popularité de l'épreuve était intacte. Le photographe (lauréat notamment d'un Istanbul Photo Award, d'un Pictures of the Year International Award) qui a étiré le plaisir sur le Tour féminin (soit 5693 km en 28 étapes) a tiré de l'expérience une collection de photos, une aventure humaine triée, restituée dans un livre \" Instantanés du Tour de France \" (disponible à l'Atelier/Galerie Taylor, 7 Rue Taylor 75010 Paris). L'esprit de fête et l'humanité éclatent sur chaque cliché. L'envers du décor est restitué avec sensibilité et prouve, après la pandémie, la force d'épreuve dont les spectateurs sont aussi des acteurs. Une sélection des meilleurs portraits établie par les organisateurs du Tour de France sera exposée tous les matins au Village départ, au départ de chaque étape.\n\nTour de France, Théâtre des hommes, Jean-Paul Ollivier, édition Mareuil.\n\nSur les étals de nos chères librairies de quartier, il y a des noms qui attirent tout de suite l'œil et qui offrent l'assurance d'un bon moment de lecture. Faut-il encore présenter Jean-Paul Ollivier, le Monsieur Histoire du Tour de France durant quatre décennies sur le service public ? Le Breton à la retraite (depuis 2017) conte les plus grandes épopées et drames de la Grande Boucle à travers de courts chapitres (110 au total) à dévorer sur la plage, entre deux baignades, avec, dans un coin de la tête, la petite voix enveloppante du reporter passionné qu'il est et qu'il restera à jamais.\n\nLuc Leblanc, L'important c'est de rester vivant, éditions Solar\n\nIncontestablement l'autobiographie de l'année de la planète vélo. Luc Leblanc, champion du monde 1994, champion de France 1992 et ancien porteur du maillot jaune, se livre comme jamais dans un récit touchant qui débute par le drame ayant marqué son existence : la mort de son petit frère, fauché sous ses yeux par un chauffard. Le petit Luc, 12 ans, a lui aussi été percuté avant de rester de longues semaines hospitalisé, grièvement blessé à une jambe. Cette blessure, qui le poursuivra tout au long de sa carrière, ne l'a pas empêché de devenir l'un des coureurs français les plus brillants de sa génération. Elle est, comme la disparition de Gilles, le fil d'Ariane de sa vie. Son ascension, ses victoires au panache, son admiration sans limites pour Poulidor, ses relations parfois orageuses avec Virenque, Fignon, ou Guimard, sa rencontre avec Tapie, le dopage et la prise d'EPO, le fiasco de son aventure au Groupement ou de celui de son projet de jean sans coutures, ses joies, ses peines mais aussi le désespoir de l'après-carrière accompagnent le lecteur pendant près de trois cents pages. Un récit formidablement bien écrit, nourri de quelques expressions savoureuses sorties de la bouche de ce Limousin. À lire absolument cet été pour découvrir ou redécouvrir \"Lucho\".\n\nRaymond Poulidor, Serge Laget et Jean-Paul Vespini, éditions Mareuil\n\nDéjà plus de trois ans que Poulidor nous a quittés (en novembre 2019), Serge Laget et Jean-Paul Vespini, deux plumes incontournables du cyclisme, avaient raconté en 2013 cinquante années de Tour de France (de 1962 à 2012) à travers les yeux de notre \" Poupou \" national, que ce soit dans la peau du coureur, du commentateur puis de l'emblématique figure de la caravane. Le duo a rajouté les récits des éditions allant de 2013 à 2022 en s'appuyant sur les témoignages de ceux qui étaient aux côtés de cette légende du vélo, d'une popularité et d'une générosité sans égal. Un récit marquant.",

                "body": "Cheptegei is looking to polish ahead of his bid to retain the 10000m gold medal at the Budapest World Athletics Championships later in August.\n\nUganda's Olympic champions Peruth Chemutai and Joshua Cheptegei arrived in Swiss city Lausanne with varying goals.\n\nThe pair will compete over the women's 3000m steeplechase and men's 5000m races respectively during the Lausanne Diamond League (DL) Meeting on Friday.\n\nBudapest in sight\n\nCheptegei is looking to polish ahead of his bid to retain the 10000m gold medal at the Budapest World Athletics Championships later in August.\n\nHe, along with 15 other men, will go for the 12-and-a-half-lap race under the lights at Stade Olympique de la Pontaise.\n\nThis is Cheptegei's second track race this month after striking fourth place over the same distance during the Florence DL in Italy on June 2. \"It's only a few weeks after Florence, his shape there was already good,\" his coach Addy Ruiter said on Thursday.\n\nTime won't matter?\n\n\"So the improvements you can make are very small. It's especially important now that in Budapest, he also has the right mind-set for winning a gold medal in the 10000m.\"\n\n\"For tomorrow (Friday), the target is running a tactical good race, time is not important,\" added Ruiter. In Florence, Cheptegei posted 12 minutes and 53.81 seconds for his second fastest 5000m in 23 career races.\n\nWith Cheptegei lagging behind, that race had particularly been slow for 10 laps until Olympic 10000m champion Selemon Barega kicked with 800m to go.\n\nAfter a fast 5000m race at the Oslo DL in Norway where Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha and Ugandan Jacob Kiplimo tied at the tape on June 15 with 12:41.73 - the fastest this year - Cheptegei will definitely keep an eye on his watch.\n\nEthiopian test awaits\n\nIn Lausanne, Cheptegei still has a duel with Barega and six other Ethiopians including experienced two-time world champion Edris Muktar, World Cross-country silver medallist Berihu Aregawi and Haile Bekele Telahun who posted a new personal best of 12:46.21 in third place in Oslo.\n\nNow onto the lady Chemutai. She ironically is among the top athletes yet to qualify for the Budapest Worlds Athletics. Chemutai hasn't posted nine minutes and 23 seconds or under over the water-jump race since the window opened on July 30, 2022.\n\nC'mon Olympic queen!\n\nThat opening closes on July 30 and yet, according to her management Global Sports Communication (GSC), this is her last race in plan before Budapest.\n\n\"The target for Peruth is to run the entry standard,\" admitted her coach Ruiter. Chemutai's season track bow was tough. She finished in a distant 11th place with 9:31.71 during the Doha DL in Qatar on May 5.\n\n\"She was in and after Doha sick for some weeks. For weeks, the training has been going well but she needs more weeks to be in top shape again.\"\n\nChemutai, who also won the Commonwealth steeplechase bronze medal in Birmingham, England last August, is in a field comprising Kenyans Fancy Cherono and world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech.\n\nThere is also a quartet of Ethiopians like Mekides Abebe but world U20 silver medallist Sembo Almayew is the fastest this year with 9:00.71 while Zerfe Wondemagegn is second best with 9:04.61.\n\nUGANDANS IN ACTION - FRIDAY\n\nLausanne Diamond League: Peruth Chemutai (3000m steeplechase), Joshua Cheptegei (5000m)\n\nWorlds Appearances: 11th (Oregon 2022), 5th (Doha 2019), 8th Heat 3 (London 2017)\n\nMajor Honours: Tokyo 2020 Olympics (Gold), Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (Bronze), 2018 World U20 Championships (Silver), 2015 Commonwealth Youth Games (1500m Silver & 3000m Silver)",

                "title": "New pro women's hockey league to launch in January after deal with Dodgers co-owner, AP sources say",
                "body": "A new women's pro hockey league will begin competing in North America as early as January, a development made possible Thursday when a co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers purchased the Premier Hockey Federation, two people with direct knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press.\n\nThe seven-team PHF will cease operations, one of the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deal between Dodgers co-owner Mark Walter and the PHF had not been announced. The new league will bring together North America's most accomplished female players and would likely include the more talented players from Europe and Asia who are already competing in the PHF.\n\nMark Walter's firm acquired what one of the people described as ''certain assets'' of the PHF. The league had been locked in a dispute with the rival Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association. The PWHPA -- which includes a majority of U.S. and Canadian national team players -- had been working with the Mark Walter Group and Billie Jean King Enterprises over the past 14 months in a bid to launch its own league.\n\nA third person familiar with the details also confirmed the purchase by the Mark Walter Group, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because details of the acquisition haven't been made public. Players for both the PHF and the PWHPA were informed of the deal in two separate private meetings, the person said.\n\nThe PHF had been scheduled to begin its ninth season this fall. The new league will feature PWHPA chief Jayna Hefford and PHF Commissioner Reagan Carey in leadership roles, one of the people said.\n\nThe PWHPA certified as a union this spring and has completed negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement. A 62-page CBA was presented to PWHPA members on Thursday night, and they will have until Sunday night to ratify it and the new league's constitution, said one of the people, who has received the document.\n\nIf approved, the deal will run through 2031 and features a minimum salary of $35,000 for players on active rosters, the person said.\n\nIn the meantime, PHF players' existing contracts have been voided, though an agreement is in place to pay those under contract a portion of their salary through September, the person said. Some players are losing out on contracts they signed worth more than $150,000 over two seasons.\n\nAmong the many issues that need to be sorted out include the number of teams and where they will play. The PHF, which doubled each team's salary cap to $1.5 million entering this season, has teams in Boston, Toronto and Montreal along with East Rutherford, New Jersey; Hartford, Connecticut; Buffalo, New York; and Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nThe higher salaries helped the PHF attract several high-profile international players, including Switzerland's Alina Muller, Sweden's Emma Soderberg and former Finland goalie and ex-PWHPA board member Noora Raty.\n\nBy essentially eliminating the PWHPA's rival, the deal fulfills the desire of many women's hockey fans -- including NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman -- to have a single league. Though the NHL provided support to both the PWHPA and PHF, Bettman has urged the two factions to come together for the good of the sport.\n\nIn March, former Canadian Olympian and current Czech Republic coach Carla MacLeod pressed the issue further. The 40-year-old told The AP that having one elite league would help other countries start catching up to the sport's traditional powers, the United States and Canada.\n\n''If you look back into the men's game, that's when the gap closed,'' MacLeod said, referring to the NHL welcoming European players in the 1970s and eventually Russians in the late '80s.\n\nNorth American women's pro hockey has been divided since the PWHPA was formed in 2019 following the financial demise of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\n\nPWHPA members balked at joining what was then called National Women's Hockey League, which was later rebranded as the PHF. The PWHPA instead pursued its own vision of having a controlling interest in a league with a sustainable economic model and fair wages for players.\n\nDani Rylan Kearney launched the NWHL in 2015 as an investor-funded four-team league that was essentially run out of an office in New York. The NWHL nearly folded a year later before the league slashed player salaries by nearly half.\n\nRylan Kearney was forced to step down as commissioner in 2020 when the league restructured its governing model by bringing in private ownership and establishing a board of governors.\n\nEarlier this month, PWHPA board member and U.S. national team star Hilary Knight insisted that the PHF was not the best model for building the women's pro game, even if the divide in the sport persisted.\n\n''I make this distinction. The more women we can have get paid to do the sport they love, I think that's awesome,'' Knight said.\n\n''What bothers me is the illusion of professionalism and what women's hockey should be, and settling for what it is, right? And I think that's the big distinction is let's call it what it is,'' Knight said.\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

                "body": "A roller-coaster of a day at the Lord's Cricket Ground saw England finish proceedings with 278/4 on the board, trailing Australia by 138 runs in the first innings. While Australia would be on the lookout for early wickets, the hosts would want the partnership between skipper Ben Stokes and Harry Brook to flourish into a big one.\n\nEngland did well to claw their back into the second test a bit on the second day, with both their batting and bowling units contributing. The game is well poised, with England trailing by 138 runs and have two well-set batsmen in Harry Brook and Ben Stokes at the crease. The highlight of the second day was a brilliant century from Steve Smith and a fighting 98 from Ben Duckett for England when not many had fancied him in the playing eleven. Ollie Robinson has come under some severe criticism for his antics from the Australian media, but he once again proved himself he is here to stay with some top-notch bowling. England versus Australia 2 Ashes test day 3 will be telecasted on the Sony Sports Network and streamed on the SonyLiv app from 3:30 pm IST.

Ben Stokes has not been in the best of forms, but we know he can hang in there. With Jonny Bairstow and Stuart Broad still, to come in, England will feel they have a chance to take a lead in the first innings.\n\nMitchell Starc has been leaking runs at an economy rate of above 6, which is a massive problem for visitors. Pat Cummins is yet to pick a wicket but has kept the opposition under check. The track is not offering much to the bowlers and hence it is imperative the Aussies look to maintain their line and length intact.

                "body": "AceShowbiz - Kevin Costner is said to have alleged his estranged wife Christine Baumgartner demands nearly $250,000 in child support payments for plastic surgery. In court documents, the \"Yellowstone\" actor, 68, reportedly claimed his forensic accountant had found the 49-year-old handbag designer - who filed for divorce in May - spends more than $100,000 in cosmetic surgery procedures which he apparently says is the real reason she is asking for the money.\n\nThe papers obtained by Page Six amid the couple's increasingly bitter divorce fight also showed Christine has spent thousands of dollars on shopping, construction loans, attorneys' fees and other expenses that have \"nothing\" to do with her children.\n\nChristine, who has children Cayden Wyatt, 16, Hayes Logan, 14, and Grace Avery, 13, with Kevin, previously argued the $248,000 a month she is requesting is \"less than the amount needed to maintain the children in their accustomed lifestyle.\"\n\nShe also claimed she has \"no income\" of her own and has been a \"stay-at-home\" mum since 2007 when her oldest child was born. But Kevin is said to have stated in the new court documents that he believes $51,940 a month, which is what he's currently paying, is a \"reasonable\" amount.\n\nChristine filed for divorce after 18 years of marriage, citing \"irreconcilable differences,\" and the exes' finances have so far been the biggest point of contention.\n\nKevin's personal finances were recently laid bare as part of the split fight after the actor appealed for them to be kept private.\n\nChristine detailed in a court filing how much the actor made and spent last year in an effort to protest how much she will receive in spousal support. Papers showed Kevin and his family splurged nearly $12 million on expenses in the last 12 months.\n\nKevin had argued in court documents also obtained by Page Six he did not want his financial information to be made public out of fear that \"irreparable harm\" will be done to him by fraudsters.\n\nPapers showed he earned a total of $19,517,064.32 before taxes due to income he accrued from TV and film projects, rentals and social security. He and his family spent $11,921,543.89 in expenses last year, leaving Kevin with a 2022 net income of just over $7.5 million.\n\nA huge slice of Kevin's spending went on his three homes, including a property in Santa Barbara, California, another in Aspen, Colorado, and a third called the \"Beach House\".\n\nChristine is seeking $248,000 per month from Kevin to help raise their three children. Court papers revealed she wants a small fortune to maintain the lifestyles of her and Kevin's kids.\n\nShe also wants Kevin to pay for their kids' private-school tuition, extracurricular activities, sports and health care expenses, according to the court documents.",

                "body": "Dr Martin McIntyre is one of those hidden figures and servants behind one of the most formidable setups in Irish sport for the past decade.\n\nHe would have been the first team medic to arrive on the scene of Tom Parson's horrific leg injury sustained against Galway five years ago and other such emergency zones but even then he'd have been unobtrusive, in keeping with the Belmullet man's unassuming personal nature.\n\nLast month though in London at the FIFA Isokinetic Pursuit of Excellence conference, as well as at the appropriately-titled Cutting Edge conference in the University of Limerick, McIntyre briefly took centre stage to launch a process and device that seriously detects and reduces the most common injury in Gaelic and professional football.\n\n\"The moment it came to a head for me was in 2017 when we lost two players in the All Ireland semi-final replay [against Kerry through hamstring injuries and had just two weeks to get them ready for the final,\" he explains. \"They'd each suffered grade-one tears, which are basically four-week injuries so you were in a race against time.\"\n\nThey'd win that race, thanks to the diligence and efforts of the likes of McIntyre and Dr Seán Moffatt and other selfless members of that medical support team. In the dressing room straight after the Kerry replay a phonecall was put in securing spots in a cryotherapy chamber for that evening.\n\nOn the bus back to Mayo both players were hooked up to a Game Ready therapy machine in the back-row seats. Then for the next week they received around-the-clock rehab from the likes of McIntyre so they could not just play but perform, resulting in the pair of them and their teammates bringing Dublin to the brink in what was possibly the best All Ireland final ever.\n\n\"Hamstring injuries have increased significantly over the last 10, 15 years, even for all the advancements in preparation and technology. And I could see that working with teams. You were kind of ahead of the research that way, seeing the trends within teams, and then the research confirmed it.\"\n\nAs part of his doctorate from his alma mater Liverpool John Moores University, McIntyre found that the amount of hamstring injuries in Gaelic had doubled over the decade.\n\nIn a bad season you could lose 10 players to hamstrings; in a good year you'll still lose about three for some time. So to help reduce and cure such injuries, he has invented a device, designed by the sports engineering group in Sheffield Hallam University. It's called the H-RIG, as in a hamstring rig. Last month at both the conferences in Limerick and London, a video was played on a loop of Aidan O'Shea illustrating his running motion and how the device and system works.\n\n\"Seventy percent of hamstrings occur when you run,\" explains McIntyre, who happened to coach O'Shea with both Breaffy and Mayo a few years back.\n\n\"It's either just prior to touchdown, which we call late swing, or on touchdown, which we call early stance. And the reason it occurs in those positions is because that is when they are under most pressure; you are required to tolerate anything between 3,000 to 4,000 newtons of force. So we decided if this is where players are getting injured, why not test them in late swing or early stance to see how strong their hamstrings are? Can they tolerate the forces required there?\n\n\"So we put the athlete like an Aidan into our device where he sits into the frame we've designed in a position where his knee is extended at a 150 degrees angle and his contralateral (non-tested) limb into 20 degrees of extension. His ankle or heel is put into a foot-hook which has a force transductor or a load-cell that's linked to an iPad and software system and that measures the amount of force that's transmitting through the hook.\"\n\nAll in all McIntyre's isometric hamstring assessment device costs just shy of €20,000 but already a couple of GAA counties have viewed it as an investment rather than a cost while leading football clubs from Spain, Portugal, Brazil and the UK have followed up from the FIFA conference with queries and orders. The reason is obvious.\n\nIt will reduce the number of hamstring injuries during the playing season and ensure greater player availability for training and games. Players can identify and address any underlying deficits they have which would make them more susceptible to injury. S&C coaches know where to strengthen them up. A medical team can give an accurate prognosis of how long rehabilitation will take, if a player is good to go back or if they're vulnerable to a recurrence of the hamstring injury.\n\nMcIntyre at some stage or another has worn all those hats. He was a decent athlete himself; at 17 he went on trial to Glasgow Celtic and after he returned from John Moores with a degree in sports science, back when no such course existed in this country, he played a season in the League of Ireland with Limerick City.\n\nBy then his day job was in Tralee IT, running their new human performance laboratory. Soon, on top of coaching the Sigerson team for a stint, he was brought into the Kerry senior setup. Páidí Ó Sé wouldn't have had a reputation for being particularly scientific but McIntyre's experience of the man was that he hugely receptive to whatever could improve his players and team.\n\n\"I remember the first day going into training and getting this massive clap in the back. Páidí loved to give the old warm clap in the back! He knew I was from Mayo but more than that he knew I was a Gaeltacht man as well, being from Belmullet, so you had that connection straightaway. And as long as he found you were genuine and helping his players he was very welcoming and supportive of all you did.\"\n\nMcIntyre in his six years with Kerry would liaise closely with Páidí and Jack O'Connor, team trainers like John O'Keeffe and then his Tralee IT work colleague Pat Flanagan but particularly so players such as Seamus Moynihan.\n\nDuring James Horan's tenure Mayo would take pride in their Ali-like mantra and application of doing the work away from the lights but for McIntyre it was the prototype of what they should aspire to.\n\n\"He was the type of guy that if you weren't pushing him he wouldn't come to you for advice. He needed, wanted to be pushed. So you'd have to push him physically to make sure he could get back on the pitch and that he knew he had the work done and hadn't any weakness where he might have had before.\"\n\nMcIntyre was there for the All Ireland wins of 2000, 2004 and 2006 but the latter two in particular were bittersweet on account of the identity of their opponents in the final.\n\n\"I remember ringing my mum and dad in the lead-up to those finals and them being so optimistic because of the vibes in the county and how well the team had played to get there. But I was privy to how the Kerry lads were flying in training going into those games and in the back of my mind I was thinking, 'God, Mum and Dad, I think all your hopes will be crushed because it's going to take something extremely special to beat this Kerry team.\"\n\nAfter the last of those All Irelands he finished up with Kerry and in Tralee IT, giving up the security of a permanent job there to upskill and go back to college, this time in Sheffield to study sports medicine. He was only finishing it up and returning home when he got a call from Fergal O'Donnell in Roscommon and subsequently played a part in that county's 2007 All Ireland minor win and 2010 Connacht senior title success.\n\nBy 2013 he had linked up with his native county, helping make it one of the most respected medical and backroom teams on the scene. Upon Horan's return in 2019 McIntyre was promoted and entrusted to being the team's defacto high performance co-ordinator as well as a selector, a role he fulfilled up to the 2020 All Ireland final after which he reluctantly stepped down to complete his doctorate.\n\nHis knowledge and experience of all those fields means he has a particular unique and authoritative perspective on the splurge of hamstring injuries in his sport, prompting an innovation and intervention like the H-RIG.\n\n\"One of the biggest factors for me is that players are getting quicker. If you look at the GPS readings, your top speeds 10 years ago would have been about 35km per hour. Now your top players, say a Tommy Conroy, he would be hitting over 36 and sometimes 37km per hour. They're more conditioned, they're stronger, and the pitches are better. But that's putting a huge amount of load on your hamstrings.\n\n\"And as well as that the game is evolving. At the conference in UL last month there were a number of sports medicine practitioners from professional football and spoke of how with more teams now sitting back and playing on the counter-attack, there's more accelerations and decelerations, which means there's more load on your hamstrings. That in turn increases the injury risk.\n\n\"And in Gaelic football we can see with the way the game is evolving, you're seeing teams being more defensive and going maybe three minutes without touching the ball before suddenly you see five or six players counter-attacking and getting to top speed very quickly.\"\n\nIs there a style of play so that is more hamstring-friendly?\n\n\"In an ideal world you'd find a balance. If you're trying to beat a blanket, you might not have players hitting top speeds that often; there's a lot of play round the edges, looking for an opportunity to break through the line. There isn't as much accelerations or decelerations, though you might attempt to hit top speed eventually during a phase of play.\"\n\nAs the high performance co-ordinator with Mayo and any role he has had as a sports scientist and medic, liaising with various other coaches and support providers in the setup, he has put a primacy on data.\n\n\"You're almost taking the emotion out of it. You need to be cold and objective in terms of what is your plan, what should be the performance plans of each player, what in the setup do we need to improve in?\"\n\nAnd yet he knows emotion drives so much of this too. Multiple members of the Mayo setup still recall at one team camp a week out from an All Ireland semi-final, Horan asked each member of the circle to speak about the cause they were serving.\n\nMcIntyre quietly but powerfully spoke about the morning of a Connacht final in Castlebar, he got in a 6am run on a remote beach and on his drive back to shower at home he came across a man in his mid-sixties, dressed in his Sunday mass shoes and pants, wearing a Mayo jersey.\n\n\"It would have been seven o'clock in the morning. He'd have had to walk for two hours to even get into Belmullet town to get a lift for Castlebar. He was a man that had seen many a game, I would say. Just as the amount of preparation the players and backroom members put in, that man heading off on his journey to see our team was putting in his preparation too. This meant as much to him as any of us.\"\n\nAs someone who has gone on some journey himself, from Belmullet to Liverpool, to better his field and Mayo, McIntyre could relate.",

                "title": "The untold stories of Andy Murray's epic 2013 Wimbledon glory - by those closest to him",
                "body": "A decade ago, Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion. This is his story told by those who built him\n\nAs we approach the tenth anniversary of Andy Murray's first Wimbledon title, Simon Briggs asked members of his family and entourage to recall their memories of a tumultuous fortnight\n\nJudy Murray (mother): I'd seen how devastated Andy was when he lost the final to Roger Federer the year before. I was just praying that everything went right with his body and that he could cope with all the pressure and distraction that comes with Wimbledon.\n\nJez Green (fitness trainer): Andy knew how good he was. In the previous year's final, he had been a set and a break up on Roger, then the roof closed and Roger started doing Roger things. Andy got his revenge in the Olympic final, winning in straight sets. But in 2013 there was a question mark about his back, which had locked up during the Italian Open six weeks earlier. In the end, we decided to skip the French Open, thinking \"What's the point, when we could have an extra month training on the grass?\" It was partly physical and partly strategic. But I think Andy might have needed a cortisone shot to deal with that back.\n\nMark Bender (physio): I got called in by my colleague Andy Ireland in May 2013. Andy had pulled out of the French Open and he was in a bad way. MRI scans showed that one joint in his vertebrae was really badly damaged. He had pain referring down his leg. And in a way, I think it worked in his favour. Having felt that he couldn't get through five-set matches in Paris, he began to improve physically, and he was really thrilled to win Queen's. He began to think, \"Gosh, I've got nothing to lose here.\" It took a bit of pressure off him.\n\nFriday, June 21: The Wimbledon draw throws up Benjamin Becker (no relation to Boris) as Murray's first-round opponent. On paper, he is expected to play Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals.\n\nJudy: I'd been around long enough never to look beyond the first round. In the media, people would be plotting out the route to the final as soon as the draw comes out, but I'd think \"For goodness sakes, one match at a time.\"\n\nMarion Bartoli (women's champion in 2013): On the Sunday before the tournament started it was raining and we were the last two players still practising at Aorangi Park before they closed the courts. Andy said to me later, \"I knew we would go far, both of us, because we were the only ones standing there.\"\n\nJudy: During matches, I'd try to sit next to Leon on the end seat. Somebody I have known forever, somebody who knows I don't want to be spoken to during a match. No chit-chat!\n\nLeon Smith (childhood coach and Davis Cup captain): In a support box like that, you don't want everyone going mad, because it would look ridiculous. We had a nice balance: Ivan [Lendl] being deadpan, Matt [Little, Murray's fitness trainer] being high energy, Kim [Murray's wife] who knows exactly what Andy needs. You have to be locked in for the whole match, because you don't want Andy to look up and see someone having a chat or eating a Haribo.\n\nJamie Murray (brother and future doubles world No 1): I wasn't in the box during that tournament. It's just not that comfortable. You have to be aware of how you're reacting because all that stuff gets picked up by him. I'm happier watching on TV.\n\nBender: Ivan is a man of few words, someone who can say chapters and chapters with a single stare. He was the rock of the team, pulling all the different people together. I found it amazing that, after practices or matches, Ivan would just say \"Well done, Andy\", pick up his golf clubs and head out to the course. But then you could see that, when Ivan said something as simple as \"You're moving well on court\", Andy's whole body-language would lift.\n\nIvan Lendl (coach): I don't think about 2013 that much. When I do, I just remember how well Andy played. You know me. I don't think backwards or forwards.\n\nRob Stewart (fixer): I lived 15 minutes away from Andy and I used to drive him up the A3 from Oxshott to the All England Club every morning in this beat-up old Volkswagen Polo. We would chat about something and anything, football or politics - but never tennis. That Polo was always the shabbiest car in the whole of the Aorangi car-park, which I thought was very Andy. If you're driving to Wimbledon every day, do you want to be sat there in a car that's garnering attention?\n\nBender: Judy would bring her mum's shortbread along in an old-school metal tin. It would get passed around the player's box, as well as Andy's friends and family. When it was passed to you, you felt like you were taking holy communion. And once he had got through the first couple of rounds, it became an essential part of the experience. It was bloody beautiful shortbread. The sugar level was pretty high, but we needed that boost to get through.\n\nMonday, June 3: After defeating Becker, Lu Yen-hsun, Tommy Robredo and Mikhail Youzhny all in straight sets, Murray faces the dangerous Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in the quarter-finals.\n\nJudy: It was funny when Andy drew Fernando Verdasco in the quarters because it cast my mind back to Andy's first Challenger tournament, when he was just a skinny 16-year-old kid with shorts too big for him. It was in Segovia, near Madrid, and I remember the journey being quite traumatic as I tried to cope with driving on the other side of the road. Verdasco was three or four years older and he won 6-1, 6-3, but towards the end Andy was starting to get the hang of his pace of shot. I was thinking \"Wow, this is it, the next level!\" And then, as I was sitting in the bar afterwards, one of the much older players said \"Do you mind if I sit with you?\" He started to talk to me about the dangers of the tour, things Andy would have to look out for, match-fixers and people offering vitamins that might not be vitamins. I remember thinking \"Oh my God, this is going to be a completely different ride to the junior circuit!\"\n\nMatt Little (fitness trainer): Both Rafa [Nadal] and Roger [Federer] had lost in the opening rounds, which put a really palpable pressure on Andy. By the time he reached the Verdasco match, I think he was very much feeling that pressure from the public.\n\nJudy: Before the quarter-final I met Sir Alex Ferguson in the player restaurant for tea. Chats with Sir Alex were like gold dust, and he's been a huge source of advice to me and Andy since 2005. I walked him down to Centre Court and of course we were followed almost immediately by fans and photographers. One guy was walking backwards while facing us with the biggest video camera I ever saw. He said \"Sir Alex, a few words for the Spanish media?\" Sir Alex says \"Yes, of course. Adios amigo.\" Then he turns to me and says \"It's very important to have two words in every language that all mean the same thing.\"\n\nGreen: Verdasco started like a train, hitting the ball so big. I didn't think Andy was gonna lose but I was thinking we needed something. Then Andy hit a running pass on quite a long point and it changed the vibe of the match. From then on, he was on fire.\n\nJudy: Verdasco is so dangerous, but if you hang with him, get him to a point where he starts to lose concentration or get annoyed with himself, it's always possible to turn things around. And Andy knew that. Still, for a while it looked like \"Here we go again.\"\n\nWednesday, June 5: After a five-set epic over Verdasco, Murray faces surprise semi-finalist and No 24 seed Jerzy Janowicz for a place in the final.\n\nDani Vallverdu (assistant coach): The rain-break during the Janowicz semi-final was funny. It was one set all and Andy is freaking out because they're going to close the roof. This guy's playing well, serving bombs, so Andy was very concerned. And then they both go to have a shower, and Andy comes out and says, \"He's just singing away in there! I think we're gonna be okay.\"\n\nLendl (asked if he remembered the story about Janowicz singing during the rain-break): It may surprise you but I don't follow guys into the shower.\n\nGreen: After the semi-final, Dan Bloxham [head coach at the All England Club] brought some wine down to where the gym was underneath the stadium. Ricky Gervais came down as well. Andy was very nervous to meet him, because he is a big Office fan - that's classic Andy deadpan humour. Gervais was a good guy, broke the ice really well, and then Janowicz had a glass with us as well. It was a really nice moment.\n\nSunday, June 9: Through to his second final at Wimbledon, defending champion Novak Djokovic awaits with the Serbian having won the last four Grand Slams titles and defeating Murray in the Australian Open final in January that year\n\nSmith: On the morning of the final, I remember meeting Judy for breakfast in Wimbledon village, so early that it wasn't even busy yet. There was a real buzz - maybe a bit more expectation than against Roger the previous year, and nervousness because of that.\n\nJudy: Before the final, I was sitting on the balcony of the player restaurant by myself. I had a cup of tea and lemon iced doughnut. I had one on the first day for Andy's first match, and I kept doing the same thing every match-day, like a superstition. I didn't really want one for the final, because I was so nervous. But I didn't want to break the superstition just in case. And I got a text from one of my friends saying, \"How's your doughnut?\" It turned out they were watching BBC TV in Glasgow and one of those drone things had picked me up on the balcony. I thought, \"There's no privacy anywhere.\" Anyway, it worked.\n\nStewart: When you're driving in on the A3, there are certain pinch points where everybody slows down. As we all do, you look around and see what's going past you and stuff. We were used to people double-taking when they saw Andy. But on the morning of the final, I remember that one car came back alongside five or ten minutes later. They had written \"Come on Andy!\" on an A4 pad of paper and were holding it up against the window.\n\nLittle: The pre match warm-up was quite funny because Novak's team had gotten down to the warm-up area before us. There was no space for Andy out there, so I ended up warming him up in this really tight corridor outside the gym. I always throw balls for Andy to react to, and because I was so nervous, I was throwing them all over the place, which wasn't lost on him.\n\nVallverdu: The tactic was to make Novak go for his shots. He needed to feel that, if he just rallied, Andy would punish him. If you look at the error count for Novak, it's probably higher than his average that day. If you don't increase Novak's error count, you're in trouble. Andy stuck to the plan. He served brilliantly, and returned brilliantly too. Almost every time he was able to get his racket on the ball, he was putting it back in play.\n\nGreen: Early in the match, Andy started going \"My shoes are wrong, I need a new pair!\" He was hysterical, going bananas.\n\nBender: The thing with Andy, he can just forget stuff, not pack things. This wasn't like a one-off. Most of the time, the rest of the team would have everything - extra kit, often because he would say \"Oh gosh, I forgot this.\" In this case, I think it was orthotics rather than shoes.\n\nStewart: There'd been a lot of chat about how slippery the courts were that year. Several players fell and injured themselves. Anyway, Dani picked up that Andy wasn't happy about his shoes, and word got passed back that he didn't have a spare pair. I think it was maybe 2-1 in the first set. I had the car-keys in my pocket, and I ran back - proper sprinting - to the grassy car-park at the back of Aorangi, and then buzzed out onto the A3. At Andy's house, I didn't even get out of the car, or go into the drive. We had rung ahead, and someone threw the shoes over the wall. I made it back to Centre Court at 3-2 in the second set, and if you put that into Google Maps, it's theoretically impossible. Amazingly, I didn't get a speeding ticket. I remember thinking to myself, \"Wouldn't this be a great story if he won and it was all down to the shoes?\" But do you know what? He put them down by the umpire's chair, and never even put them on.\n\nBender: In the seven years I spent with Andy, there was always the sense of uncertainty. Is there something missing from the kitbag? Is he cramping? Does he want electrolyte? In that team environment courtside, you have very heightened senses. He's one of those guys who gets his competitiveness from being in the trenches. He wants to rage against someone or something to get him in the red zone. Whether it's screaming \"I haven't got my f---king shoes\" or \"I haven't got my orthotics\", it's definitely a process to raise his intensity. He would create chaos in the team to achieve it, like John McEnroe ranting at the chair umpire. When I stopped working with him in 2019, my blood pressure dropped by about 30 per cent.\n\nVallverdu: I think Andy was calmer that year, he was controlling his ups and downs. Lendl helped him with that, and also with the clearness of the game-plan. Andy was going after his serve and forehand, and sticking to that even when things were not going well. There were tricky moments against Novak, moments when he could have reverted back to being more defensive. He didn't, which was the key.\n\nJudy: I don't remember much about the final. I do remember removing myself from the player's box, sitting three or four rows further back. That player's box is an uncomfortable place to be because it's mixed. You're sitting there with your own friends and family and Andy's team, but also the supporters of your opponent. Having done it the year before and hated it, I also knew you if move yourself back you're not in the front line for the photographers.\n\nGreen: That last game was insane. If Andy had lost it, and Novak had broken back to 5-5, it would have got very interesting, Novak was saving all these match points, and he was smiling. It's not a good sign when Novak starts to smile. But I remember that when Novak had a break point, Andy had this short forehand, and he hit it cross-court at a sharp angle for a clean winner. It was a very difficult shot because he was close to the net, so he had to get the ball up and down quickly, but he went after it with total commitment. I have a clear memory of thinking, \"He's got this.\" And then he wrapped it up two or three points later.\n\nJudy: I usually remember big points and opportunities, but in this instance I don't' remember anything about the final till 40-0 in the last game. I was sitting muttering to myself, \"Just one serve, Andy! Bash it! Smash it!\" My teeth were gritted. I could hear and feel my heart banging away. I was surprised no-one else could hear it. Then it was deuce. Novak got a net-cord, and it was break point. I wouldn't tell you what I said, because you couldn't print it. But inside I was saying \"Please don't let this happen.\"\n\nVallverdu: That last game was the first time ever - and probably the only time - I felt Ivan nervous. And what gave it away is that he was not speaking for 15 minutes, which is very unlike him. Usually, he talks to you the whole match. I mean, literally every point he will say something. But he was completely silent.\n\nJudy: During the match there was a Buster Bloodvessel lookalike sitting near me in the stand. He would stretch across the aisle and give it the fist-pump whenever Novak won a point, shout whatever they say in Serbian. I could see him out of corner of my eye. I was thinking \"I've got enough stress to deal with, I don't need that football mentality as well.\" I never looked at him, never blinked or wavered, but when Andy won he was right across the aisle to say congrats. That's the thing about sport, you can say what you want while it's going on, but you shake hands afterwards. Still, I was worried that he was gonna punch me at first.\n\nAndrew Castle (commentator): When Andy finally closed it out, Tim Henman - who was sitting next to me in the cramped BBC commentary box - jumped up and put his arms in the air. The problem was, his elbow whacked me in the temple as he did so. I had a bump for days. There I was, trying to find the perfect line for this great moment of sporting history, and really we're all just fortunate that I didn't say \"Aww, f---!\"\n\nJudy: The first thing Andy did after Novak's backhand hit the net was turn around and look at the press pack. Which was quite interesting because he had had, certainly in the early years, a really rough time with the media. He was the only one after Tim and Greg [Rusedski], so everything was on him. I don't know for sure, but I suspect he was thinking \"There you go, you can stop asking me when I'm going to win Wimbledon.\"\n\nBender: Andy came with the Pat Cash celebration, running up to the player's box to hug everyone. It was just absolutely mad, total pandemonium.\n\nJudy: Because I was standing so far back, I didn't go to join in. People were saying \"Go down, go down.\" The reason I didn't is that I had been blasted for so many years for being a pushy parent. I thought \"I'll just get it in the neck again.\" Andy turned around and started heading back to the court, and the crowd shouted \"What about your mum?\" I thought \"Okay, I'll go down.\" When he hugged me, that's when Dijana Djokovic [Novak's mother] came out to shake hands and say congrats. That was such a lovely moment. We had known each other since the boys were 11. Many times when Novak had beaten Andy, I had sought her out to say congrats.\n\nJamie: I watched the final on a laptop in Stuttgart with my wife. We were going there to play the tournament the following week. It was quite a weird situation, and the stream wasn't even that good. Of course, it would have been great to be there to see him, but the reality was, it definitely wasn't a sure thing. He was playing Novak, he had lost a bunch of finals to that point. I was just glad that he won. I didn't really care that I missed it.\n\nEleanor Preston (Wimbledon interview manager): I happened to pass the warm-up area underneath the stadium about five minutes after the presentation ceremony. Andy was sitting there, completely alone, in his sweaty whites with his racket-bag next to him. And he was just staring at the floor, expressionlessly. Processing, I would say.\n\nGreen: In the locker-room there was champagne going everywhere. Everyone was pumped and laughing. For some reason I took a picture of the trophy with Andy's dirty socks and ankle braces. Andy was very tired but relieved, happy and confused in equal measure, trying to figure out what he had done. Those two actors, Gerard Butler and Bradley Cooper, came down and said \"Well done.\" There were famous pictures of them in the Royal Box during the match, they were so into it. You know what these guys are like, they go towards the winner. And what with Gerard having a Scottish connection, he was an Andy guy. Until he became a Novak guy a couple of years later!\n\nJudy: As soon as I had watched the trophy ceremony, I had to go into organisational mode. To get wristbands for all Andy's friends and family so that they could go up to the competitors' lawn to celebrate. To get champagne and glasses. To work out who was going to the Champions' Dinner, because it's not as if we were turning up to watch Andy with our ballgowns at the ready.\n\nGreen: I do remember being up on the lawn and David Cameron was walking across the bridge from the members' area on his way out of the grounds. I'd had a few glasses and I yelled \"Thanks for coming, Dave!\" Then I was like \"Oh, f---, I just called the Prime Minister Dave\". His security people weren't too happy, but he was fine, he just smiled. Everyone was very relaxed, very happy. It might seem a bit indulgent to say it, but I felt like there was a really good mood across London for the next 24 hours.\n\nJudy: We had two tables at the Champions Dinner. You go down to the locker-rooms and they've been transformed into an Aladdin's cave. For the men, it's tuxedos, shoes and grooming. For the women, it's wall-to-wall gowns and pashminas, bags, stylists and make up. Not only for you, but for whoever is gonna come with you. I feel like I didn't relax at all until we got to dinner. It was very late and everyone was starving. Andy's media had taken four hours, we were waiting for him, and the Wimbledon restaurants had closed so there was no food. We got to the Savoy and we were in a little holding room with Marion Bartoli. I remember joking to Dr Bartoli, \"You and me on the first dance.\" I didn't realise that it wasn't actually a ball anymore. I'd grown up loving the first dance. But it was just a dinner. I think Andy was really relieved he didn't have to do it.\n\nBartoli: Andy had so much press to do, he was exhausted. He arrived at 11:30pm-ish, we started quite late. I had my Louboutins, 16cm heels, and I'd been standing for like three hours waiting for him. My feet were so painful, especially with five blisters from my final. My foot was all taped up. But I wore boots so nobody could see that I was wearing socks. By the time he arrived, I could barely walk.\n\nLittle: After the match, actually it was quite strange, because we barely saw Andy. He came into the locker room, we said a quick congratulations, and then he disappeared off, to be photographed with the trophy, do the media stuff, get his suit fitted. He didn't sit on the table with us either at the dinner, he sat at the champions' table. I just remember going into Wimbledon the following morning to pick up all our stuff and I finally saw him sitting there on the lawn with the trophy in between some more media stuff that he was doing. I don't remember the conversation, but I remember the look on his face. I'd never seen him so content.\n\nBender: There's still a real brotherhood of that time. When you go through something quite exceptional, it keeps a bond between people. But I do remember that Andy's back didn't last much beyond Wimbledon. As soon as he got on the hard courts, it seized up again, and he went under the knife for a discectomy in September.\n\nJudy: The next year, when we went back to Wimbledon, I thought \"Right, here we go, have a lemon doughnut and a cup of tea and hope that the same thing happens again.\" And guess what? They'd stopped stocking lemon doughnuts.\n\nSimon Briggs (Telegraph tennis correspondent): Usually we reporters try to maintain a sense of impartiality. But in this instance, for the only time in my career, I broke with protocol. At the morning-after press conference, I asked Murray to sign my Wimbledon pass.\n\nMost of my colleagues did the same. Sports hacks tend to be a cynical, unsentimental bunch. But as Murray ended the 77-year wait for a male British champion at Wimbledon, we were caught up in the unfolding sense of history. You could go through an entire career and never see anything quite like July 7, 2013. The pass is still hanging in my study.",

In the final six months of 2022 we had three prime ministers ... three chancellors ... and 37 ministerial resignations outside a reshuffle (h/t the IFG). Since January 1 we've had one, one and four. Boring! But haters of stability need not fear. The election may be less than a year away.\n\nGood Friday morning. This is Dan Bloom. Rosa Prince returns on Monday.\n\nTHERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME: As if we've all woken up sweating back in the COVID nightmare, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will return to 9 Downing Street's blue-hued press room at noon flanked by two senior medics to tell a nervous nation the NHS can -- we promise -- turn things around.\n\nOK, calm down: It's only the long, long-awaited 15-year NHS workforce plan.\n\n**A message from Palantir: Whether rolling out the COVID vaccine, cutting NHS waiting lists, accelerating cancer care, resettling Ukrainian refugees, enabling Royal Navy vessels to spend longer at sea or leading in AI, at Palantir UK we're proud that our software is helping the Government solve some of the UK's most important challenges.**\n\nWall-to-wall: Health Secretary Steve Barclay is on the Today program at 8.10 a.m. and Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting is also doing a broadcast round. Rishi Sunak is visiting a hospital in the east of England (pics but no pool clip), followed by the presser then a weekend at Chequers. Barclay is likely to give a follow-on statement to the Commons on Monday.\n\nSpin all about it: After a 5,913-word press release with 43 (!) supportive quotes -- but not all questions answered -- the 130-page document should be published this morning from about 9 a.m. Barclay's op-ed in the Telegraph (splash here) calls it the \"most radical\" reform since the NHS was founded, 75 years ago next week. NHS England Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard in the Mail calls it a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity.\"\n\nGetting the band back together: The press conference is due to feature Pritchard and NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis, both of whom graced the £2.6 million blue room in the COVID days.\n\nPLAN IN BRIEF: £2.4 billion over five years ... medical school training places doubled to 15,000 a year by 2031 ... 24,000 more nurse and midwife training places by 2031 ... 60,000 doctors and 170,000 more nurses by 2037 ... a consultation on cutting medical degrees from five years to four ... 16 percent of training places offered through apprenticeships by 2028 ... and letting student nurses start work when they graduate in May, rather than having to wait until September.\n\nBIGGEST NUMBER: The Mirror's Martin Bagot hears that the entire workforce in NHS England will expand from 1.4 million to 2.2 million by the end of the 15-year plan.\n\nBlack hole: The NHS also claims the plan aims to cut the agency staffing bill by £10 billion between 2030/31 and 2036/37. There are now 112,000 vacancies which would reach 360,000 by 2037 without action.\n\nThe bad numbers: Labour circulated a background briefing with the grimmest waiting list figures, including the 520,000 who waited more than four hours at A&E in May.\n\nDEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL: Wonks will pore over the document to see if it answers key questions about funding and timescales. For example, the release says the number of medical school places will rise by \"almost a third\" by 2028 ... but double by 2031. That means most of the growth is only at the end of this decade.\n\nGETTING IN EARLY: Labour's Wes Streeting said \"they should have done this a decade ago\" ... the Royal College of Nursing says the key will be the amount and length of funding ... Unison says pay review bodies must be fixed.\n\nNot impressed either: The Health Foundation said \"optimistic assumptions\" about improving productivity \"will be a pipedream without significant investment.\" It added: \"The disappointing lack of detail made available around the announcement makes it impossible to comment on the substance.\"\n\nLONG ROAD: This plan, promised \"shortly\" in January, was at one point expected in the week of the March budget. The Times splash says officials \"have been locked in talks with a sceptical Treasury,\" which eventually \"backed the key planks.\"\n\nDEJA VU: The Express splashes \"Rishi's radical plan to fix NHS once and for all.\" But this is not the first plan nor will it be the last. While it's bigger and beefier, we have an aging population, funding strains and pressure that only ever seems to go in one direction.\n\nOn repeat: Playbook reporter Noah Keate trawled for some of the NHS' many past plans. To name only a few, there's ... The COVID backlog plan promising to \"grow and support the workforce\" and recruit 10,000 nurses from overseas (February 2022) ... the Build Back Better plan promising to \"improve workforce planning\" (September 2021) ... The NHS Long Term Plan which promised a \"comprehensive new workforce implementation plan\" (January 2019) ... The planned workforce strategy to 2027 (August 2018) ... The 5-year NHS funding plan with 3.4 percent real-terms rises to mark the NHS' 70th birthday (June 2018) ... and a Five Year Forward View that promised to \"commission and expand new health and care roles\" (October 2014). Not to mention Andrew Lansley's ill-fated reforms, natch (April 2013).\n\nGood timing: A health committee report says NHS England should break from the rigid \"Agenda for Change\" pay scale to hire digital specialists -- as some areas lack even the most basic IT equipment.\n\nThat'll do it! The public should \"get fitter\" to protect the NHS, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has told the BBC.\n\nWHATSAPP, DOCKET? A day after the Rwanda drama, the High Court battle between the government and the COVID inquiry it set up begins at 10.30 a.m.\n\nNoBoJo: Ex-PM Boris Johnson has been the test case, but this fight isn't really about him -- especially as he said he'd hand over his phone messages directly. It's about whether the independent inquiry has the right to demand unredacted messages from a slew of ministers and officials so that the inquiry, not government lawyers, can decide what's relevant.\n\nWhich means ... the messages of (among many others) Sunak and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, whose chummy WhatsApp style in former Health Secretary Matt Hancock's leaked trove already raised many eyebrows. Wonder if they'll be named in court?\n\nBreakfast reading: Both sides' skeleton arguments for today's case -- which goes on until mid-Monday -- should be published later today, possibly on the judiciary website. While you wait, the Cabinet Office dumped out 227 pages of documents (here, here, and here) four weeks ago explaining its case and confirming formal requests for WhatsApps had already gone to Case, ex-PM Liz Truss and others.\n\nPANNICK IN THE COURTS OF LONDON: Both Johnson and his ex-aide Henry Cook -- the other subject of a \"test case\" request by the inquiry -- will also have legal representation in court. Johnson's is David Pannick, the peer who represented him at great public cost in the Partygate committee hearings. Website The Lawyer, which broke the news, adds \"treasury devil\" James Eadie will spar for the government and Hugo Keith for the inquiry.\n\nHENLEY NON-GRATA: A spectacular row has erupted in Tory safe seat Henley, where the Conservative Party board \"abandoned\" the selection on Thursday due to what it called \"breaches of the parliamentary candidate selection process.\" News emerged in an e-mail leaked to Michael Crick and key details were broken by the Express' David Maddox.\n\nWhat the heck's going on? A local activist told Playbook there was \"outrage\" among members after some hopefuls were \"weirdly absent\" from the longlist that was confirmed privately in recent days. The activist claimed \"there was a staggering amount of anger and bewilderment\" and some raised concerns over how the process was run. Officially the reason for halting the process was the breach of confidentiality after details leaked out.\n\nFamous names: Among the people who did make the list so far, two people confirm, was an activist by the name of William Hall -- who by coincidence is the son of Tony Hall, the former Director General of the BBC. Ex-Olympic rower James Cracknell was also going for the seat, and is reported by Maddox to be among those who complained to CCHQ.\n\nWhither Boris? Long tipped for the \"chicken run\" before he quit parliament, Boris Johnson's team insist he has nothing to do with all this and has no plans to run in Henley. Tory chiefs are confident that he can't run anywhere anyway -- because he's not on the party's approved candidates list.\n\nWhat happens now? It's all up in the air with no timetable yet to restart. Expect this one to run and run ...\n\nMEANWHILE IN LONDON: The Cabinet Office will not investigate the claim that dropped-out Tory mayoral hopeful Daniel Korski groped TV producer Daisy Goodwin's breast, she tells the Times. She says officials have confirmed she'll have to either do nothing or go to police, as Korski (who denies her allegation) no longer works for the government.\n\nBrick wall: Excluded mayoral candidate Samuel Kasumu has written to Tory Chairman Greg Hands urging him to reopen the London selection process to avoid the impression that \"politics trumps any semblance of fairness and humanity.\" Hands is refusing.\n\nLOOSE LIPS: With all that warm white wine at summer parties, reshuffle speculation season is in full flow. The Express' David Maddox reports Home Secretary Suella Braverman is \"set for the chop in a bloodbath,\" but LBC's Ben Kentish hears Sunak is planning a smaller government jiggle before summer recess and Cabinet changes only later.\n\nDouble-booked: Sunak needn't bother calling Liz Truss -- she's planning to launch her new outfit \"The Growth Commission\" next month, Katy Balls writes in her Times column.\n\nMEANWHILE IN LABOUR: It's a-OK for Keir Starmer to abandon many of his 10 pledges because he said made them while campaigning to become Labour leader -- not PM, one of his most loyal allies has told my colleagues Ailbhe Rea and Aggie Chambre.\n\nPledges, schmedges: Starmer's well-rehearsed line is that he's had to \"adapt\" to a changed world since he made his vows to Labour members in 2020. But while she mentions that context too, Jenny Chapman tells today's Westminster Insider: \"I think what you're seeing now is his real politics. There was an understanding of the best issues to talk about if you want to become leader of the Labour Party.\" She adds the \"essay question is very different\" when you're asking to lead \"an entire country.\"\n\nDidn't get the memo: Jeremy Corbyn's ex-policy chief Andrew Fisher retorts \"it shows a complete contempt for the membership.\" It's part of Ailbhe and Aggie's second half of their ace Starmer profile, out today.

Hardly cork-popping time in Downing Street.\n\nRWANDA FALLOUT: The Court of Appeal blow to Sunak's migrant deportations plan splashes the Guardian and the Mail, while the Independent splash asks: \"Was this the day the Tories lost the election?\"\n\nSo what now? Appeal court judges will decide \"on papers\" whether to accept a referral to the Supreme Court. Immigration barrister Colin Yeo tells Playbook \"it's obviously going to the Supreme Court,\" with the appeal court more likely than usual to refer because it was divided 2-1. The Telegraph hears Sunak is \"confident\" he can win while \"senior legal sources\" tell the Times team the case could be heard within six weeks. (Yeo thinks it'll be \"months.\")\n\nNot good enough: Tory rumblings have picked up steam -- the Mail spread's headline is \"Time to quit Euro human rights court.\" The Times' Brussels editor Bruno Waterfield also says the EU is facing calls from eight of its member countries to follow Britain's lead with a Rwanda-style scheme.\n\nOn the subject of Brussels: Hungary and Poland took a stand against a recent EU migration deal during Thursday's EU summit, blocking any EU leaders' statement on the issue. Leaders are back at it today. My colleagues have the details here.\n\nHands down: Not one person put up their hand on Question Time in Exeter when asked if they back sending people to Rwanda. Here's the clip.\n\nMORE WATER WOE: The Guardian airs concerns Thames Water could delay its annual accounts after it refused to say when they will be published.\n\nLORDS OF THE INTERNET: The Online Safety Bill is back in the Lords on Tuesday and the government has tried to head off a revolt by announcing a string of amendments. One forcing age verification on adult websites could, the Telegraph says, make punters give face scans. Labour claims ministers are been dragged \"kicking and screaming.\"\n\nWHAT A COUP: Defense editors all have more gear on a line from a Sun story from Monday -- that head of the army Patrick Sanders is expected to step down. His allies tell the Telegraph he is being forced out after criticizing planned cuts to troop numbers, with one telling the Guardian Defense Secretary Ben Wallace \"didn't like that.\" The Mail's Mark Nicol suggests a fallout with his armed forces boss Tony Radakin is to blame. Wallace insisted on Thursday \"there's no conspiracy.\"\n\nSLAPP DEBATE: Ex-Minister David Davis has used parliamentary privilege to air detailed claims about Mohamed Amersi, a donor to the Conservative Party. In Thursday's debate about \"strategic litigation against public participation\" Davis alleged: \"What was it that Mr Amersi wanted to conceal with his SLAPPS?

                "body": "The flying car developed by Alef Aeronautics is based in San Mateo, California.\n\nAlef Aeronautics has obtained official permission to operate its flying car from the US government. The car manufacturer recently announced the acquisition of a Special Airworthiness Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as confirmed by Aero Law Center, a renowned aviation law firm. This significant milestone marks the first-ever certification granted to a vehicle of this kind in the United States.\n\nSEE ALSO: From Unfold To Unhappy: Google Pixel Fold Users Face Screen Snags Within 24 Hours Of Buying\n\nAlef Aeronautics issued a statement acknowledging that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently engaged in developing policies regarding electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. The company also noted the FAA's efforts in establishing regulations for the interaction between eVTOLs and ground infrastructure.\n\nAccording to a report from Fox News, the flying car developed by Alef Aeronautics is based in San Mateo, California. This innovative vehicle operates solely on electricity and has the capacity to accommodate one or two individuals. With a price tag of approximately $300,000, the car offers the unique capability of flying over congested traffic and bypassing road accidents.\n\nIn October 2022, Alef Aeronautics made a significant announcement by unveiling a full-sized sports car, accompanied by two fully functional technology demonstrator cars. Additionally, the company revealed that it had received more than 440 pre-orders for its vehicles, including orders from individual customers as well as corporate consumers. According to reports, Alef Aeronautics has set a target to commence the delivery of flying cars to customers by the end of 2025.\n\nSEE ALSO: Your Instagram And Facebook Feed Is Influenced By AI\n\nAs stated on their website, Alef Aeronautics is developing the flying car specifically for operation on both urban and rural roads. The vehicle is designed to be compatible with regular parking spaces and can fit inside a standard-sized garage. However, due to its classification as a low-speed vehicle, it is limited to a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour on paved surfaces. Alef emphasizes that the car's primary purpose is to provide flight capabilities for faster routes, assuming that if a driver requires a quicker journey, they would utilize the car's aerial functionality.\n\nSource",

Apparently, some official from the Italian government contacted Mark Zuckerberg about staging a UFC fight against Elon Musk at the Colosseum in Rome! That's according to TMZ Sports, which has sources claiming both Facebook and Tesla bosses are up for it.\n\nIt seems like they're serious too - the report says Zuckerberg was contacted by Italy's Minister of Culture a few days ago. Facebook then told Dana White at UFC headquarters and their people went back to the Italian Ministry. Height discrepancies could render fight negotiations tricky though, especially when it comes to body weight - Musk has approximately 85 pounds on Zuck!\n\nNo events have taken place inside Colosseum in hundreds of years but Macca played an exclusive charity show there quite recently-ish (in 2003?) so anything really can happen. Naturally I have absolutely no idea if this is or isn't true makeup for your own mind as you go along folks because WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT on that one.#zoopsia",

                "body": "Now a founder of online fitness platform BODYPLAN and co-owner of F45 gym in The Elysian in Cork, Stringer says the two keys to success he has picked up in his professional career are routine and balance.\n\n\"Having been in professional sport, [training] is all about routine and getting things in place so that you know when things should happen, and things tend to run smoothly most of the time,\" he says.\n\nNutrition is vital for Stringer too. When you eat a balanced diet, he says, and \"fuel your body with the right types of foods, then you'll be able to get the rewards from a training perspective\".\n\nI like to keep my day pretty active. I don't sit at a desk all day, which is a big plus in my eyes coming from professional sport. I like to get up early before the kids wake up and get my training done.\n\nWeight training and running are what I enjoy. I'm still able to run, my knees and ankles are all good, so I'm going to keep doing that as long as I can.\n\nWhat are your guiltiest pleasures?\n\nI love chocolate and cakes like everybody else, but I have no guilt if I do eat something sweet. I find the easiest approach is to allow yourself [a treat] on a daily basis, but understanding not to overdo it.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nMy three-year-old son. Our day starts at 4.30am when he gets up and decides it's morning time.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nThe hour and a half in the gym, even though it's tough and strenuous. Everyone needs that little bit of space to themselves and for me that's it.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nA new car, and there's something about freshly baked bread as well.\n\nWhen was the last time you cried?\n\nProbably three years ago when my second son -- Oscar -- was born.\n\nDishonesty. During my career, when you're playing you like to have honest conversations with people. There's nothing worse than someone not speaking their mind and agreeing with you, and then behind your back saying something else about it to somebody else.\n\nWhat traits do you least like about yourself?\n\nAt times, like everybody, I get stressed and bring work home with me. That's probably something that I need to focus on, in terms of keeping things separate and just being in a moment with my family.\n\nWhat cheers you up if you're having a bad day?\n\nJust being around my two kids and my wife, when they're in a good mood it makes everything else seem irrelevant.\n\nWho would you invite to your dream dinner party?\n\nAn all-time favourite of mine is Billy Connolly. I'd also bring Kevin Hart, and maybe Muhammad Ali.\n\nWhat quote inspires you most and why?\n\n\"In any walk of life, whether it's sports or work or school, ultimately if it's not something you're passionate about doing, it's never going to work for you.\"\n\nI feel like I've never worked a day in my life, I do things that I love doing because it motivates me to do them even more.\n\nYou've got to have passion for something you do because otherwise you just won't commit yourself to it and it won't work.\n\nWhere is your favourite place in the world?\n\nWest Cork. We had a summer house down in Rosscarbery growing up as a kid.\n\nOn sunny days, there's just something about going back to that place.",

                "body": "By STEVEN WINE\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nBaseball's anthem \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\" was crafted by two Tin Pan Alley songwriters who had never attended a game. By contrast, the tunes on \"Grand Salami Time!\" come from a band with extensive knowledge of the sport.\n\nThe album is the fourth by the Baseball Project, and the group - Scott McCaughey, Steve Wynn, Linda Pitmon, and former R.E.M. members Peter Buck and Mike Mills - mines nostalgia and esoterica to find fresh subject matter for 16 songs.\n\nWe're talking inside baseball: A tribute to pitcher Jim Bouton makes a veiled reference to his career record of 64-64. The song \"New Oh in Town\" salutes Japanese heroes past and present. \"Screwball\" cleverly merges two subjects as it recalls players who pitched more than a century ago.\n\nMost topics are paired with garage rock that gives Buck a chance to serve up some delightful guitar squall. Also contributing is co-producer Mitch Easter, who worked on R.E.M.'s early albums.\n\nThe band finds room for such contemporary clatter as launch angle, exit velocity and WHIP, but the best songs involve a different kind of analytics. The bluesy \"Erasable Man\" laments the color line, while the acoustic folk of \"That's Living\" contemplates life's short season.\n\nAs on previous albums, a few lyrics could use a sports editor, or any editor. \"Eight-hundred-sixty-eight longballs would fly\" just isn't singable. But no band bats 1.000.",

                "body": "Forty three years after the grand finale of the Ramat Cup in Enugu, the battle of wits is still on. Paul Okoku, playing for Bolaji Oni Babes, Lagos was sent off by the referee. Charles Okonkwo starred for Enugu Black Rocks.\n\nThe Lagosians were humiliated 3-0 after Okoku's exit and he insists that the red card, his first ever, was issued because apparently, the referee wanted to impress then old Anambra State governor, Jim Nwobodo.\n\nOkonkwo disagrees with Okoku for trying to diminish the feat of Black Rocks, full of youthful stars who went ahead to prove their mettle as key members of Enugu Rangers, the Flying Eagles and Green Eagles respectively.\n\n\"I can't even remember the guy (Okoku) being given a red card in that match. We were clearly the better side and beat them convincingly. We were good young players and we knew it,\" Okonkwo, also known as Hurricane said.\n\nHurricane Charlie spared no words in dismissing Bolaji Oni Babes.\" The Lagos Boys were full of ' Shakara' and noise, like Stationery Stores... the usual shenanigans like Lagosians. But we were unperturbed and confident that we will beat them. And 90 percent of the Enugu team went on to play for Bricawaves and then ended up with Rangers.\"\n\nTo show that Black Rocks were solid, Okonkwo added, \"this our young side went on to beat Stationery Stores who would later represent Nigeria in the African Winners Cup the next year.\"\n\nTarila Okoronwanta was already an Adebajo Babe in 1980 and had to be flown in from Lagos for the grand finale. He joined Raymond King, Chris Anigala, Tajudeen Disu, Samson Siasia, skipper Lawrence Akufie, John Ekpere,Odion Itohan, Segun and Femi Olukanni against the hosts.\n\nBlack Rocks were led by Benedict Ugwu, alias Surugede. They had players with funny nicknames. Charles Okoye chose Warrior. Kingsley Onye was Mature, Nzekwe stuck to Harass, one bore Dankuruba, another went for Nkpokiti. There was also Equaliser.\n\nChristian Obi, Ejike Ekwueme, Ikechukwu Ofoje, Benjamin Okaro, Joe Oha, One Touch Aneke, Ofoma and Anibeze completed the list. Coaches Eto Amaechina and Obinwa handled he squad.\n\nOkonkwo credited Amaechina with deciphering the body language of the Lagosians. \" Yes, Eto had their swag that's why he actually understood what was going on.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: Abortion Saga: \"Insults Won't Work,\" Yvonne Nelson Slams Sarkodie After Diss Track\n\nHe was right. Amaechina, an Igbo, lived in Lagos all through the Civil War years managing Stationery Stores. While his contemporaries were fighting for Biafra, he was preparing to follow the Green Eagles to the Mexico 1968 Olympic Games. At the last minute, Nigerian officials dropped him.\n\nSparks of Ilorin lost to Bolaji Oni in one of the semi finals while Black Rocks defeated Kano in the other. Sparks captain, Alausa Ahmed ( Alasco) bagged a red card and team mate, Kayode Omotose feels it was undeserved and made it possible for the Lagosians to sail through.\n\nOkonkwo agrees. \"Infact, the team we feared was the team from Ilorin who were much better than the Lagos team. They were accidentally knocked out in the semi final. We watched that game and were praying for the Lagosians to win because we were very confident of beating them. Full of skillful players, they were the team to beat.\"\n\nSparks paraded a great team. Their talisman was inside left, Alausa. Gafar Ijaya, Saliu Isiaka and Wahab Ahmed were quite outstanding. Keeper Abdulraheem Ajao, right back Bamidele Aturu, Sule Gegele, Lateef Yusuf and Omotose excelled as well.\n\nHowever, Alausa was exceptional. Omotose described him as \"a master dribbler with his wicked left leg. Great passer of the ball, he could locate any player at any part of the field. The red card depleted our capacity in the midfield.\"\n\nAlausa was an all rounder. In 1977, he led the Government Secondary School, Ilorin 4×100 metres Relay quartet that came out tops in Kwara State. The other three were Saliu Salami ( Abella ), Bolakale Magaji ( Black Lee ) and Segun Ajomale ( Shege).\n\nThat event was hitherto dominated by Ilorin Teachers College ( ITC ) and Federal Government College ( FGC ) Ilorin. It ended in 1977 and Alausa was the major reason for that achievement.\n\nThat same year, he led the school to the final of the Kwara State Secondary Schools Football Championships. Many expected Government Secondary School Ilorin to win as they had done four years earlier n the days of Frank Omenka, Taofeek Aziz, Victor Aniago, Steve Olarinoye and Frank Odiachi.\n\nAlausa's team mates included keeper Saka Balinga, Ikechukwu Aporo ( later Emosobum ), Segun Ajomale, Belgore Olarongbe, Saliu Salami, Kale Magaji, Bello Ibrahim ( Kapila ) and Muraina Ibrahim ( Brimo ). Others were Ajetunmobi Wahab and Gandu Andrew. Unfortunately, they lost 1 - 0 to Okene Teachers College.\n\nSomething to note about full back, Aporo who later changed name to Ikechukwu Emesobum. He was one of the five East Central State pupils that bagged scholarship in an Exchange Programme between Kwara State and the East which began in 1973.\n\nThe others, Chinaka Obasi, Udensi Okoli, Godwin Ikechukwu Abugu and Jonathan Chuks Nwosu moved to Government Secondary School, Ilorin with him while the best five pupils from Kwara were sent to College of Immaculate Conception ( CIC ) Enugu.\n\nIt was a worthy arrangement between Ajie Ukpabi Asika, Administrator of East Central State and Brig. David Bamigboye, Military Governor of Kwara State. Remarkably, both men had wives named Chinyere and they hailed from Owerri Zone.\n\nEmesobum, an Engineer, later joined politics and became Abia State Commissioner for Sports. Obasi became an Architect and lives in the United States. Okoli joined the Nigerian Customs Service.\n\nAbugu traveled to the Soviet Union for further studies. He died in the 2012 Dana air crash in Lagos. Nwosu, was studying Medicine at the University of Benin when he lost his life. Nwosu's car broke down near the Ugbowo Campus gate of the University in 1982. As he stepped down to find out what went wrong, a luxury bus hit the vehicle. He was knocked down as a result.",

                "body": "Since the dawn of time, myths represent the universal bank of human wisdom. Myths ride on stories along the superhighway of time-honoured communication. Myths affirm the supremacy of good over evil, teaching morals and preserving history, passing on traditions and knowledge; explaining the nature of man.\n\nI believe the earliest myths came into being shortly after the dew of creation set on the first heroic deed, and the sun cast the shadow of the first villain.\n\nThe compartmentalisation of humanity into race, language, religion, technology, wealth, and power, notwithstanding, myths, like in earliest times, still beam the torch on unclear events in human existence today.\n\nFor the heads that have weathered more than 50 rainy seasons, the realities of yesteryear fast-turning into myths in the eyes of today's youngsters are understandable.\n\nWhen you say the Nigerian naira was once stronger than the American dollar, members of Generation Z will wonder whether Nigeria was the paradise that existed in the Garden of Eden. When you say Nigeria's astronomical wealth of the early 70s blinded her leaders into confusion, Generation Alpha will think you're on Colorado. Memories of the Biafra War and the Golden Age of Nigerian sports are gradually turning into myths as the mind dims with age.\n\nBefore the corrupt confession of the former representative, Bauchi North Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa, backtracks into a deafening silence and returns as a roaring, improbable myth in the future, I shall, once again, lend my voice to condemn the suspected criminal collaboration Balkachuwa engineered between the upper legislative chamber and the Nigerian judiciary.\n\nThis Sallah, as Nigerian Muslim faithful supplicate to Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I'm sure the Bulkachuwa family and many money-for-judgment members of the Senate will be on prayer mats, begging God or Satan to let this cup pass over.\n\nBut Nigerians must keep the fire under the feet of the National Judicial Council, pour hot ash on the Senate, make Bulkachuwa and his wife, Justice Zenaib, who was the President, Court of Appeal, eat their corrupt excreta, accuse the Tinubu Presidency of complicity in the rot within the judiciary - if it continues to keep silent; insist on the cleansing of the Augean stable.\n\nIf Bulkachuwa had said he influenced his wife to favour the petition of the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, or that of Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, the police, Department of State Services and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission would've printed tonnes of the Electoral Act, distributed it free and swear to defend it to the death. Bulkachuwa and his 70-year-old wife would've been arrested, detained and charged to court while Atiku and Obi would've been sufficiently ridiculed.\n\nWhile Nigerians were aghast as to the sheer effrontery of Bulkachuwa and his alleged cohorts, a graveyard silence is what they got from the institutions mandated to check various forms of corruption nationwide. While a cross-section of Nigerians has risen to condemn Bulkachuwa's speech, Nigeria's anti-corruption institutions have not condemned Bulkachuwa, revealing a body language that suggests the incumbent government isn't ready for a fight against the judiciary, probably because the Tinubu government is still standing on one leg.\n\nTo refresh the memory, this is what 80-year-old Bulkachuwa said on the hollow floor of the Senate's blood-red chamber while giving his valedictory speech as the ninth Senate wound down some days ago: \"At my age, I don't think I will lobby anybody under the sun. I will do the right thing, and I always do the right thing, and sincerely and honestly too.\n\n\"So, I know, I look at faces in this chamber who have come to me and sought my help when my wife was the president of the Court of Appeal. And, I'm sure...\"\n\nPresident of the ninth Senate, Ahmad Lawan, who presided over the session, tried to stop the horse bolting from the barn: \"Em, em, eh, Distinguished Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa, I think I'll advise that you just round up and take your seat.\"\n\nBut Bulkachuwa won't listen. He continued: \"We know ourselves. I must say that ok, to roundup since that's what you want me to do, I'll do that, and I must thank, particularly, my wife, whose freedom and independence I encroached upon while she was in office, and she has been very tolerant and accepted my encroachment, and extended her help to my colleagues.\"\n\nLawan surely knows when the horse has bolted, but he still closes the barn door, saying: \"Ehh, Distinguished, please, I don't think this is a good idea of going this direction, it's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.\"\n\nThere is a universality to the didactic nature of myths, especially in relation to the proverb: \"It doesn't rain, it pours.\" This was how it poured for Eris the Greek goddess of strife and discord. Eris bore Ponos (Hardship), Lethe (Forgetfulness), Limos (Starvation), Algae (Pains), Hysminai (Battles), Makhai (Wars), Phonoi (Murders), Androktasiai (Disputes), Neikea (Quarrels), Pseudea (Lies), Logoi (Stories), Amphillogiai (Disputes), Dysnomia (Anarchy), Ate (Ruin), Horkos (Oath).\n\nNinety-year-old former Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Prof. Wande Abimbola, in a telephone chat during the week, explained to me that in the Yoruba pantheon, there are 400 plus one gods who are benign to mankind, while 200 plus one principalities are bad. Abimbola said the 200-plus-one principalities are led by Death, Sickness, Loss, Paralysis, Woe, Curse, Jail and Poverty.\n\nOn the online kerfuffle about the 'aboru boye' term used by gospel singer, Tope Alabi, I think when you understand the intertwined relationship among language, religion and culture as a form of communication to God, you will not blame Alabi for praising God, using the imagery of sacrifice, more so when her self-acknowledged Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, was a sacrificial Lamb, whose blood was shed on Calvary as a sacrifice.\n\nThe challenges besetting Nigeria are as terrible as the children of Eris, the Greek goddess, and the 200-plus-one principalities that cause trouble for Man in the Yoruba worldview. However, it's demonstrably evident that patriotism, the synonym for dedication and nationalism, will cure many of Nigeria's ailments, but patriotism is nonexistent in Nigeria's political lexicon - a reason why the Atiku and Obi petitions might be washed away in the encroaching Bulkachuwan Sea.\n\nThere's no better time to redeem the image of the judiciary than now. The NJC must, first of all, publicly condemn Bulkachuwa's show of shame on the floor of the Senate, and take an official position on the issue; the Nigerian Bar Association must raise the decibel of its voice against the monetisation of judgment in the country, the police must arrest and quiz Senator Mr and Justice Mrs Balkachuwa. Lawan must be arrested and tried for attempting to stifle the truth when he should have been outraged and given room for Bulkachuwa to spill his intestines. All the senators, judges and accomplices mentioned by Mr and Mrs Bulkachuwa should be publicly tried. Above all, President Bola Tinubu should condemn the self-encroachment confession of Bulkachuwa, his fellow party member, and call for a thorough probe of the case. This is the only way to assure Nigerians that the judiciary isn't in the pocket of the Jagaban. It's the only way to demonstrate that the Atiku and Obi petitions will get fair hearings.\n\nHa! Did I hear Atiku and Obi laugh after reading my demands? I clearly heard, \"De play.\" I also heard, \"You dey whine me?\" Did I hear right? Is all hope lost? I see a wig, a gown and a gavel floating on the Bulkachuwan Sea, going, going...",

Salah satunya dilakukan dengan kerja ekstra keras di mana Asnawi berlari dari sisi kiri tengah lapangan untuk menekel winger lincah 18 tahun itu di dekat kotak penalti.\n\nBaca Juga:Penampakan Elkan Baggott Jadi Sorotan Usai Kembali ke Ipswich Town, Netizen Ungkit Julukan Big Man saat Lawan Argentina\n\nKini, pelatih Jeonnam, Lee Jang-kwan buka suara. Dia membahas performa rekrutan anyar Jeonnam Dragons termasuk Asnawi yang baru direkrut pada Januari 2023 dari sesama klub kasta kedua Liga Korea Selatan (K League 2) Ansan Greeners.\n\nLee Jang-kwan mengaku puas dengan performa para pemain baru. Terkhusus Asnawi, dia memberikan pujian tinggi dengan menekankan sang pemain punya determinasi tinggi selama bertanding.\n\n\"Kami puas dengan pemain baru yang bergabung,\" ucap Lee Jang-kwan dikutip dari media Korea Selatan, Sports-G, Jumat (30/6/2023).\n\n\"Musim ini, tim kami diperkuat dengan caranya sendiri, dan banyak pergantian pemain asing.\"\n\n\"Di antaranya, pemain baru bernama Asnawi juga masuk dan mendapat banyak perhatian dari fans Asia Tenggara,\" tambahnya.\n\nBaca Juga:5 Alasan Kenapa Kamu Harus Nonton Drama Korea Squid Game\n\nLebih jauh, juru racik Jeonnam Dragons itu menganggap Asnawi Mangkualam mengingatkannya pada eks gelandang sekaligus legenda Manchester United asal Korea Selatan, Park Ji-sung.\n\nSelama bermain, Ji-sung memiliki kemampuan untuk menempati berbagai posisi dari bek sayap, gelandang hingga pemain sayap. Kerja keras dan keultean bermain jadi ciri khas eks Timnas Korea Selatan itu.\n\n\"Saya tahu kekuatan Asnawi karena saya menyaksikan pertandingan Ansan dan Timnas Indonesia musim lalu. Dia adalah pemain dengan kekuatan yang jelas\" ujar Lee Jang-kwan.\n\n\"Secara khusus, saya pikir dia dicintai oleh banyak penggemar karena dia adalah pemain yang menonjol karena kecepatan dan agresivitasnya. Ada banyak keluarga multikultural (pemain asing lain) di Gwangyang. Saya berharap penampilan Asnawi akan mendorong banyak keluarga multikultural dan berkumpul di stadion,\" pungkasnya.",
